# Start Here - Next Session Kickoff

Read `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` first for a quick summary, then continue below.

## Your Mission

We just completed **Phase 2: Batched Decomposition** and successfully decomposed a complex 53-work-order project in 5 minutes. The system is working, but we discovered the "4000 token limit" we built around was self-inflicted (Claude supports 64K).

Your job is to validate the end-to-end workflow and optimize what we built.

---

## First Steps (in order)

1. **Read the context:**
   ```
   Read NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt (you just did this)
   Read docs/session-state.md from v49 onwards
   Read docs/Analysis_Token_Limit_CORRECTED.md for design rationale
   ```

2. **Understand what changed:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Review the 6 new/modified files
   # 3 new services: complexity-estimator, dependency-validator, batched-architect-service
   # 3 modified: architect-service, API route, test scripts
   ```

3. **Verify the system works:**
   ```bash
   npm test                          # Should show 49/49 passing
   npx tsc --noEmit                 # Should show 0 errors
   node scripts/quick-test-long.mjs # Should decompose 53 WOs successfully
   ```

4. **Commit the batching implementation:**
   ```bash
   git add src/lib/complexity-estimator.ts
   git add src/lib/dependency-validator.ts
   git add src/lib/batched-architect-service.ts
   git add src/lib/architect-service.ts
   git add src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts
   git add scripts/quick-test.mjs
   git add scripts/quick-test-long.mjs
   git add docs/

   git commit -m "feat: Implement batched decomposition for complex projects

Completed Phase 2: Batched Decomposition System

## Critical Discovery
- We were self-throttling with max_tokens: 4000
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 actually supports 64,000 output tokens
- Fixed limits across all services resolves truncation issues

## Implementation
Created 3 new services (~930 lines):
- ComplexityEstimator: Feature-based estimation (247 lines)
- DependencyValidator: Self-healing validation (309 lines)
- BatchedArchitectService: Batch orchestrator (372 lines)

Updated token limits:
- Architect: 4000 ‚Üí 16000
- Batched Architect: 3800 ‚Üí 16000
- Complexity Estimator: 1000 ‚Üí 2000

## Test Results
Multi-LLM Discussion App (53 work orders):
‚úÖ 13 feature-based batches
‚úÖ 5 minutes decomposition time
‚úÖ All dependencies valid
‚úÖ 44 contracts generated
‚úÖ No truncation errors

## Features
- Automatic complexity estimation
- Feature-based batching (logical grouping)
- Structured context summaries (file paths + exports)
- Self-healing dependency validation
- Fast path for small projects (<20 WOs)

## Known Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è IPC contract parsing fails (non-blocking)
‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase wireframe storage broken (low priority)

Cost: ~$0.82 for decomposition, ~$17 total project

## Your Next Task: Choose a Priority

We identified 4 priorities in `docs/session-state.md`. Pick one to tackle:

### Priority 1: Test Proposer Execution (RECOMMENDED)

**Why:** This validates the entire workflow works end-to-end.

**What to do:**
1. Create a test database entry for Multi-LLM Discussion App decomposition
2. Pick 3-5 simple work orders from the decomposition (e.g., Project Foundation batch)
3. Submit them to the Orchestrator for execution
4. Monitor Proposer ‚Üí Aider ‚Üí GitHub PR creation
5. Verify code quality and test results
6. Document success rate and any issues

**Expected outcome:** Proof that batched work orders execute correctly via Aider.

**Files to examine:**
- The server console output from the Multi-LLM test (scroll up)
- Work orders in batches 1-3 (simpler infrastructure tasks)
- `src/lib/orchestrator-service.ts` for execution flow

---

### Priority 2: Fix IPC Contract Parsing

**Why:** IPC contracts are useful for multi-process apps like Multi-LLM.

**What to do:**
1. Review the error: "‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to parse contract JSON, returning empty array"
2. Debug `src/lib/contract-service.ts` IPC contract generation
3. Check if the prompt is malformed or if parsing logic is broken
4. Test with Multi-LLM spec (41 WOs involve IPC)
5. Fix and verify contracts generate correctly

**Expected outcome:** IPC contracts generate successfully.

---

### Priority 3: Update Rate Limiter

**Why:** We're artificially limiting throughput by 250√ó.

**What to do:**
1. Update `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts` line 12
2. Change rate limit from 4 req/min to 50-100 req/min
3. Update comment to reflect actual Claude limits (1000 req/min)
4. Test that batching still works (should be faster)
5. Monitor for rate limit errors from Anthropic (shouldn't happen)

**Expected outcome:** Faster decomposition, better API utilization.

---

### Priority 4: Fix Supabase Wireframe Storage

**Why:** Wireframes generate correctly but don't save.

**What to do:**
1. Review error in `src/lib/wireframe-service.ts:187`
2. Debug Supabase signature verification issue
3. Check credentials, bucket permissions, storage policies
4. Test wireframe generation with Multi-LLM spec
5. Verify wireframes save to Supabase

**Expected outcome:** Wireframes save successfully.

---

## Important Reminders

### Context You Have

‚úÖ **Working system:** Batched decomposition generates 50+ work orders successfully
‚úÖ **Test data:** Multi-LLM Discussion App (53 WOs) decomposed and logged in server console
‚úÖ **Architecture docs:** Complete analysis in `docs/` folder
‚úÖ **Rate limit data:** Actual API limits documented in session-state.md

### Context You DON'T Have (ask user if needed)

‚ùì **Decomposition JSON:** The test client timed out, so full JSON may not be saved
‚ùì **User preference:** Which priority to tackle first
‚ùì **Production readiness:** Is batching ready to deploy or needs more testing?
‚ùì **Future plans:** Should we optimize further or move to next phase?

### Things to Watch Out For

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't break existing functionality:** Simple specs (<20 WOs) use fast path
‚ö†Ô∏è **Token budgets are independent:** Architect output ‚â† Proposer context
‚ö†Ô∏è **Server already running:** Port 3000, don't kill it without asking
‚ö†Ô∏è **Uncommitted changes:** Need to commit before making new changes

## Suggested Opening Prompt

```
I'm picking up from session v49. I've read NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt and
session-state.md. The batched decomposition system is working (53 WOs
in 5 minutes).

I'd like to [choose one]:
A) Test Proposer execution with batched work orders
B) Fix IPC contract parsing
C) Update rate limiter from 4 to 100 req/min
D) Fix Supabase wireframe storage

[Or suggest your own priority based on what you learned]

Before we start, should I commit the batching implementation first?
```

## Quick Reference

**Key files you'll work with:**
- `src/lib/batched-architect-service.ts` - Main orchestrator
- `src/lib/complexity-estimator.ts` - Estimation logic
- `src/lib/dependency-validator.ts` - Validation + self-healing
- `src/lib/orchestrator-service.ts` - Execution pipeline (for Priority 1)
- `src/lib/contract-service.ts` - Contract generation (for Priority 2)
- `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts` - Rate limiter (for Priority 3)
- `src/lib/wireframe-service.ts` - Wireframe storage (for Priority 4)

**Commands you'll need:**
```bash
npm run dev                       # Server (already running)
npm test                          # Tests (49/49 passing)
npx tsc --noEmit                 # TypeScript (0 errors)
node scripts/quick-test-long.mjs # Full decomposition test
git status                        # See changes
```

**Cost tracking:**
- Multi-LLM decomposition: ~$0.82
- Expected execution: ~$16
- Total project: ~$17 (vs $16,000 human = 940√ó savings)
