I'm continuing work on implementing defensive programming improvements for the Moose autonomous development system. The previous Claude Code instance made changes to defensive constructors in service files and asked me to restart the dev server to test them.

## Context

**Project:** Moose - Autonomous software development system
**Current Task:** Phase 1 implementation of defensive programming enhancements
**Issue Being Fixed:** 500 errors on `/api/architect/decompose` endpoint due to non-defensive service initialization

## What Was Accomplished (Previous Session)

1. **Root Cause Identified:** 
   - WireframeGenerationService and ContractGenerationService had non-defensive constructors
   - Services used non-null assertions (`!`) on process.env without validation
   - Caused mysterious 500 errors when env vars were undefined or unavailable at module import time

2. **Changes Made (Need to Verify):**
   - Implemented defensive constructors with environment variable validation
   - Added lazy initialization pattern (initialize on first use, not at import)
   - Added clear error messages with setup instructions
   - Distinguished between required (throw) and optional (warn + degrade) dependencies

3. **Files Modified:**
   - `src/services/wireframe-service.ts` (defensive constructor + lazy init)
   - `src/services/contract-service.ts` (defensive constructor + lazy init)
   - Possibly `src/lib/architect-service.ts` (if it called these services)

4. **Environment Variables Status:**
   - Local `.env.local`: Fixed to point to correct Supabase project
   - Vercel dashboard: Fixed to point to correct Supabase project
   - All required env vars are present and correct

## Current Status

**Last instruction from previous Claude Code:** "Restart the dev server to ensure defensive constructor changes take effect"

**I need you to:**

1. **First, show me what changes were made:**
   - Display the current state of defensive constructors in:
     - `src/services/wireframe-service.ts`
     - `src/services/contract-service.ts`
   - Confirm lazy initialization was implemented correctly

2. **Restart the dev server:**
   - Stop any running dev server
   - Start fresh: `npm run dev`
   - Confirm server starts without initialization errors

3. **Test the defensive constructors:**
   - Test the `/api/architect/decompose` endpoint with a minimal payload
   - Confirm it works (no more 500 errors)
   - If it fails, show me the exact error message (should now be clear and actionable)

4. **Verify defensive behavior:**
   - Check that services initialize lazily (not at module import)
   - Check that error messages are helpful if env vars are missing
   - Confirm optional dependencies (Supabase) degrade gracefully

## Test Payload

Use this minimal payload to test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/architect/decompose \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"technicalSpec":"Build a simple todo app"}'
```

Expected result: Should return a successful decomposition (200 status) or a CLEAR error message explaining what's wrong.

## Reference Documents

Three key documents exist for context:
1. **Handover Document** (attached earlier) - Full Phase 1 implementation plan
2. **Phase 2 Diagnosis Report** (attached earlier) - Root cause analysis of 500 error
3. **Defensive Programming Guidelines** (just created) - Standards for defensive code

## Important Constraints

- **DO NOT** change the core decomposition logic
- **DO NOT** modify work order limits yet (that's a separate task)
- **ONLY** focus on defensive initialization and error handling
- **PRESERVE** all existing functionality

## Success Criteria

âœ… Dev server starts without errors
âœ… `/api/architect/decompose` returns 200 (or clear error, not 500)
âœ… Services initialize lazily (on first use)
âœ… Missing env vars produce clear, actionable error messages
âœ… Optional dependencies (Supabase) degrade gracefully with warnings

## If Something's Wrong

If the previous changes weren't saved or were incomplete:
1. Show me the current state of the files
2. Tell me what's missing or incorrect
3. Ask if you should implement the defensive patterns from scratch

## Next Steps After Testing

Once the endpoint works:
1. Confirm defensive constructors are working as intended
2. Test with actual Multi-LLM Discussion App specification (if available)
3. Move on to remaining Phase 1 tasks:
   - Task 1.1: Pre-decomposed spec recognition
   - Task 1.2: Increase work order limit to 20
   - Task 1.3: Missing specification detection

## Question for You

What's the current state of the defensive constructor implementation? Show me the relevant code sections and let's verify everything is working correctly.

## ðŸ“‹ Additional Context to Provide

If Claude Code asks for more details, you can also share:

### **Environment Setup Confirmation:**
```
Local development:
- Node.js version: [your version]
- Next.js version: [from package.json]
- Running on: localhost:3000
- Environment variables in .env.local: âœ… Present and correct

Production (Vercel):
- URL: https://moose-indol.vercel.app
- Environment variables: âœ… Present and correct
- Connected to GitHub: âœ… Auto-deploys on push
```

### **Key Architecture Points:**
```
Moose Agent System:
- 7 AI agents (Architect, Director, Manager, Proposers, Orchestrator, Sentinel, Client Manager)
- Singleton pattern used for services
- Next.js API routes for endpoints
- Supabase for data storage
- Anthropic Claude for AI operations
- Budget constraint: $100/day hard cap
```

### **The Specific Bug Context:**
```
What was happening:
- User pushes code with new WireframeGenerationService
- Service constructor tries to initialize Anthropic/Supabase clients
- Environment variables not available at module import time (Next.js quirk)
- Clients receive 'undefined' as API key
- Constructor throws, but error is cryptic
- API returns 500 with no useful message

What should happen now:
- Service constructor does minimal work
- Initialization happens lazily on first actual use
- Environment variables ARE available by then
- Clear validation with actionable error messages
- Optional dependencies degrade gracefully
```
