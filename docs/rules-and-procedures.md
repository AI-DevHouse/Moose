# Rules and Procedures

**Revised for Claude Code CLI with direct file access tools.**

---

## Core Rules (R1-R8)

**R1: One step only**
Execute one action, verify, then proceed. No batching.

**R2: No assumptions**
Always Read files before editing. Unknown = ask or probe.

**R3: Three-strike re-diagnose**
After 3 failed attempts with same method, STOP and change approach.

**R4: Evidence over recall**
Use tsc, tests, diagnostics. Never rely on memory for technical details.

**R5: Stop on first failure**
Don't chain operations. Diagnose before proceeding.

**R6: Security first**
Never expose API keys. Redact secrets. Use environment variables.

**R7: 100% component validation**
Complete current phase 100% before starting next.

**R8: Deep context check**
Review handover docs before technical work. Answer verification questions.

---

## Rules Removed (Obsolete with Claude Code CLI)

**Former R4 (PowerShell syntax):** No longer needed - use Read/Edit/Write tools, not PowerShell string manipulation

**Former R11 (File persistence verification):** No longer needed - tools guarantee success or error, no silent failures

**Former R12 (Content-based edits with evaluation):** No longer needed - Edit tool handles exact string matching natively without PowerShell regex issues

**Why removed:** Claude Code CLI provides direct file access via Read/Edit/Write tools. These tools handle exact content matching, guarantee success/failure feedback, and eliminate the need for PowerShell workarounds that were error-prone.

---

## Terminal Setup

**T1:** `npm run dev` (keep running - development server)
**T2:** `lt --port 3000 --subdomain moose-dev-webhook` (optional - GitHub webhooks only)
**T3:** Free for commands and tests

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Architect (Phase 2.1)
‚ùå Don't accept unstructured input ‚Üí Require objectives/constraints/criteria format
‚ùå Don't generate <3 or >8 WOs ‚Üí Too few = not decomposed, too many = overwhelming
‚ùå Don't trust Claude without markdown stripping ‚Üí Always strip ```json wrappers
‚ùå Don't block on complex dependency patterns ‚Üí Diamond convergence is valid
‚ùå Don't skip database migration before UI work ‚Üí Foreign key constraints will fail
‚ùå Don't underestimate cost impact ‚Üí 1-2 calls/day = 75-150% of LLM budget

### Claude Prompt Engineering
‚ùå Don't rely on prompts alone for formatting ‚Üí Claude wraps JSON despite "ONLY JSON" instructions
‚úÖ **Always strip markdown in code:**
```typescript
const cleaned = response.replace(/^```json\n?|\n?```$/g, '');
const parsed = JSON.parse(cleaned);
```
‚úÖ Include concrete examples (positive + negative)
‚úÖ Use try-catch for complex validations

### General
‚ùå Don't build infrastructure before validating concepts ‚Üí **FOUND.PRINCIPLE**
‚ùå Don't assume file contents ‚Üí Always Read first (R2)
‚ùå Don't confuse Aider (tool) with Orchestrator (infrastructure layer)
‚ùå Don't proceed to next phase at <100% validation ‚Üí R7
‚ùå Don't commit package.json with feature code ‚Üí Separate commits for dependencies

---

## Verification Procedures

### Session Start (Mandatory)

```powershell
# 1. Integration tests (expect 14-15/15 passing)
.\phase1-2-integration-test.ps1

# 2. Check server running
# Look for "compiled successfully" in T1

# 3. Type errors (expect 19 pre-existing)
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | Select-String "Found.*errors"

# 4. Git status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

**Known issue:** Security Hard Stop test fails on cold start. Run tests twice if needed. See [known-issues.md](known-issues.md#5-cold-start-race-condition).

---

### After Code Changes

```powershell
# 1. Type check specific file
npx tsc --noEmit path\to\file.ts

# 2. Full type check
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | Select-String "Found.*errors"

# 3. Integration tests (if touching core logic)
.\phase1-2-integration-test.ps1
```

---

### After Architect Changes

```powershell
# Test decomposition endpoint
$testSpec = @{
  feature_name = "Test Feature"
  objectives = @("Objective 1")
  constraints = @("Constraint 1")
  acceptance_criteria = @("AC 1")
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/architect/decompose" `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $testSpec

# Expected: 3-8 WOs, total_estimated_cost, decomposition_doc
```

---

### After Database Changes

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor

-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'work_orders';

-- Check recent records
SELECT id, status, created_at, updated_at
FROM work_orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## Diagnostic Commands

### Server Health

```powershell
# Check Node processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*node*"}

# Test API responsiveness
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check proposer registry
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/api/proposers | ConvertFrom-Json |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty proposers |
  Format-Table name, complexity_threshold, model

# Budget status
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/api/budget-status
```

---

### Build Issues

```powershell
# Full rebuild
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*node*"} | Stop-Process -Force
Remove-Item .next -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run dev
```

---

### Git Operations

```powershell
# Check unreferenced objects (warning after force-push/rebase)
git prune

# Restore file (only works for committed files)
git status  # Check if file is tracked first
git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file.ts

# View uncommitted changes
git diff
git diff --staged

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

---

### Tunnel Issues (Optional - GitHub webhooks only)

```powershell
# Test tunnel
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://moose-dev-webhook.loca.lt/api/github/webhook"

# Restart tunnel (Terminal 2)
# Kill existing:
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*lt*"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Start new:
lt --port 3000 --subdomain moose-dev-webhook
```

---

## Error Response Patterns

### Claude Wraps JSON

**Problem:** Despite "Return ONLY valid JSON", Claude outputs:
```json
```json
{"key": "value"}
```
```

**Solution:** Always strip markdown in parsing code:
```typescript
const cleaned = response.replace(/^```json\n?|\n?```$/g, '');
const parsed = JSON.parse(cleaned);
```

**Location implemented:** `src/lib/architect-service.ts` line ~87

**Note:** This is a model behavior issue, not solvable via prompt engineering. Always strip markdown in code.

---

### Dependency Validation Fails

**Problem:** Simple cycle detection flags valid diamond patterns (A,B‚ÜíC) as circular

**Current behavior:** Warns but doesn't block (temporary until prompt refined)

**Example:**
```
WO-0: Database schema
WO-1: API endpoint
WO-2: Integration (depends on WO-0 AND WO-1)  ‚Üê Flagged as circular
```

**Future fix (Week 4 Day 2):** Refine Architect prompt to explicitly support multi-parent dependencies, implement proper topological sort

**Files to modify:** `src/lib/architect-service.ts` (validation logic), Architect system prompt

---

### Cold-Start Test Failure

**Problem:** Security Hard Stop test fails immediately after server restart

**Root cause:** Config loading race condition - API accepts requests before system_config loaded

**Symptoms:**
```
14/15 tests pass (first run)
15/15 tests pass (second run)
```

**Workaround:** Run `.\phase1-2-integration-test.ps1` twice after restart

**Planned fix (Week 4 Day 5):**
1. Add initialization barrier (async config load before server ready)
2. Create readiness check endpoint: `/api/health/ready`
3. Test suite waits for 200 from readiness endpoint before running

**Files to modify:** Server startup logic, `src/lib/config-services.ts`, new `src/app/api/health/ready/route.ts`, test script

---

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
Phase X.Y.Z: Brief description of change

- Bullet point details if needed
- Keep under 72 chars per line
```

### When to Commit

‚úÖ After completing a feature increment (MVP or phase milestone)
‚úÖ After fixing a bug
‚úÖ After adding new dependencies (separate commit)
‚úÖ Before switching tasks
‚ùå Never commit broken code (unless explicitly testing)
‚ùå Never commit secrets or API keys

### Separate Package Changes

```powershell
# Good: Separate commits
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add @anthropic-ai/sdk dependency"

git add src/lib/architect-service.ts src/types/architect.ts
git commit -m "Phase 2.1: Add Architect service"

# Bad: Mixed commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add Architect and dependencies"
```

**Why:** Cleaner history, easier rollback, clearer blame tracking

---

## Git Commit Procedure

**Only create commits when requested by the user.** If unclear, ask first.

When the user asks to create a git commit:

1. **Parallel git commands:**
```powershell
# Run these in parallel
git status
git diff
git log --oneline -5
```

2. **Analyze changes and draft commit message:**
- Summarize nature (new feature/enhancement/bug fix/refactoring/test/docs)
- Ensure accurate reflection of changes and purpose
- Do not commit files with secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc.) - warn if requested
- Draft concise 1-2 sentence message focusing on "why" not "what"

3. **Parallel commit operations:**
```powershell
# Add relevant files
git add [files]

# Create commit with message
git commit -m "Phase X.Y: Description

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Check status
git status
```

4. **If commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes:**
- Retry ONCE if hook modified files
- Check authorship: `git log -1 --format='%an %ae'`
- Check not pushed: `git status` (should show "Your branch is ahead")
- If both true: amend commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit

**Important:**
- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (push --force, hard reset) unless explicitly requested
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign) unless explicitly requested
- DO NOT push to remote unless user explicitly asks
- NEVER use git commands with -i flag (requires interactive input)
