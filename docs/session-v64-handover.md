# Session v64 Handover - Work Order Generation In Progress

**Session Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** Work orders being generated (AI-based parsing implemented)
**Next Session:** Monitor completion, start orchestrator

---

## Current State: CRITICAL - WO GENERATION IN PROGRESS

**DO NOT INTERRUPT THE NEXT.JS SERVER** - Background process on shell `2f6f75`

### What's Happening Now:

Work order generation is **actively running** in the background:
- **Next.js server:** Running on port 3000 (PID varies, check `netstat -ano | findstr ":3000"`)
- **Progress:** Section 3/15 in progress (last check: 10:42 AM)
- **Work Orders Created:** 115+ so far (59 from Section 1, 56 from Section 2)
- **Expected Total:** 300-400 work orders
- **Estimated Completion:** 11:00-11:30 AM (30-60 min total runtime)

### Check Progress:
```bash
# Monitor Next.js logs
# Find the background process and check output
powershell.exe -Command "Get-Process node | Where-Object {$_.StartTime -gt (Get-Date).AddHours(-1)}"
```

Or check database directly:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM work_orders WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951';
```

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. ‚úÖ AI-Based Spec Parsing (MAJOR IMPROVEMENT)

**Problem:** Regex-based parsing failed (only found 1 section from 77K spec)
- Line ending issues (Windows `\r\n`)
- Fragile pattern matching
- Couldn't handle document variations

**Solution:** Replaced regex with AI parsing
- **File Modified:** `src/lib/spec-preprocessor.ts`
- **Change:** `parseDocumentStructure()` now calls Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Result:** Successfully identified **15 logical sections** from the spec

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD: Regex-based parsing (lines 82-167)
// NEW: AI-based parsing using Claude API (lines 79-216)

async parseDocumentStructure(content: string): Promise<PreprocessedSpec> {
  // Ask Claude to identify sections with start/end markers
  const prompt = `Analyze this technical specification and identify
  all major sections that should be implemented as separate work packages...`;

  const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({...});
  // Returns: { sections: [{section_number, title, start_marker, end_marker}] }
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Script Issues

**File:** `scripts/submit-tech-spec.ts`
- Changed `technical_spec` ‚Üí `spec` (line 39)
- This matches what the API expects

### 3. ‚úÖ Port Management

- Killed processes on ports 3000/3001
- Ensured Next.js runs on port 3000 (hardcoded throughout system)
- Server stable and processing

---

## Architecture Understanding Gained

### Batched Decomposition Flow:

1. **AI parses document** ‚Üí 15 sections identified
2. **For each section sequentially:**
   - Estimate complexity ‚Üí Determine # of batches needed
   - **For each batch sequentially:**
     - Pass previous work orders as context
     - Generate new work orders that reference previous ones
     - Build dependencies automatically
3. **After all sections:** Validate dependencies, detect cycles

### Why Sequential is Necessary:

Each batch receives context from previous batches:
```typescript
// src/lib/batched-architect-service.ts:240
const contextSummary = this.buildContextSummary(previousWorkOrders);
// Returns: "WO-0: Setup Electron | File: src/main.ts | Exports: ElectronApp"
```

This maintains architectural coherence across 300+ work orders.

### Work Order Execution Sequencing:

Orchestrator uses **dependency resolution** (not explicit ordering):
- Polls every 10 seconds for pending WOs
- Filters to those with `auto_approved = true`
- Executes only WOs where ALL dependencies are completed
- Up to 3 concurrent executions (if dependencies allow)
- **Topological sort happens dynamically** via `dependency-resolver.ts`

## Next Steps for New Session

### Step 1: Check if WO Generation Complete

```bash
# Check Next.js logs
netstat -ano | findstr ":3000"
# Get PID, then check if process is still running

# Or check database
# SQL: SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(created_at) FROM work_orders
#      WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951';
```

**Expected:** 300-400 work orders with status='pending'

### Step 2: Verify Work Orders Look Good

```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/list-work-orders.ts
```

Check for:
- Reasonable titles (not about "Document Termination Marker")
- Dependencies set correctly
- All have `metadata.auto_approved = true`

### Step 3: Start Orchestrator Daemon

```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Polls every 10 seconds
- Max 3 concurrent executions
- Each WO takes 1-2 minutes
- Total time: 2-4 hours for 300 WOs
- PRs appear on GitHub as WOs complete

### Step 4: Monitor Execution

**Key Metrics:**
```sql
-- Progress
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM work_orders
WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
GROUP BY status;

-- Failures
SELECT failure_class, COUNT(*) FROM outcome_vectors
WHERE work_order_id IN (SELECT id FROM work_orders WHERE project_id = '...')
GROUP BY failure_class;

-- Cost
SELECT SUM(cost) FROM cost_tracking WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Step 5: Analyze Results & Document

Update `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md` with:
- Final success rate (target: 60%+)
- Failure breakdown by type
- Total cost (budget: $150)
- Issues discovered
- Assessment: Production ready?

## Important Files

**Modified This Session:**
- `src/lib/spec-preprocessor.ts` - AI-based parsing (lines 79-216)
- `scripts/submit-tech-spec.ts` - Fixed field name (line 39)

**Key References:**
- `docs/session-v62-handover.md` - Previous session context
- `docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_Moose_Workflow.md` - Complete system reference
- `src/lib/batched-architect-service.ts` - Batching logic
- `src/lib/orchestrator/dependency-resolver.ts` - Execution sequencing
- `src/lib/orchestrator/orchestrator-service.ts` - Main execution loop

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **DO NOT restart Next.js** until WO generation completes
2. **Check database** to confirm all WOs created before starting orchestrator
3. **Let orchestrator run** - Don't stop it prematurely (2-4 hours)
4. **Monitor costs** - Should stay under $150 total
5. **Document everything** - This is the first real production test

---

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Architect successfully decomposes spec (AI parsing: WORKING)
- ‚è≥ At least 60% of WOs complete successfully
- ‚è≥ Generated code compiles
- ‚è≥ PRs created on GitHub
- ‚è≥ Total cost under $150
- ‚è≥ Failure data properly classified

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### WO Generation Stuck:
- Check Next.js logs for errors
- Verify Claude API key works: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Check if process crashed: `netstat -ano | findstr ":3000"`

### Orchestrator Issues:
- Ensure `npm run dev` is running (port 3000)
- Check dependencies blocking execution: See logs for dependency graph
- Verify auto_approved: `SELECT metadata FROM work_orders LIMIT 1`

### High Failure Rate:
- Review `failure_class` in outcome_vectors table
- Check if it's systematic (all failing) or random
- Consult troubleshooting in `docs/session-v62-handover.md`
