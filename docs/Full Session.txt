> 1 +  Session v50 Handover - PR Creation Fix Needed
         2 +  ================================================
         3 +  
         4 +  📍 STATUS: Priority 1 complete - pipeline validated, one bug blocking full success
         5 +  
         6 +  🎯 YOUR TASK: Fix GitHub PR creation (5-10 min fix)
         7 +  
         8 +  CONTEXT:
         9 +  - End-to-end pipeline works: Architect → Proposer → Aider ✅
        10 +  - Test showed 99% error reduction (115 → 1 errors) ✅
        11 +  - PR creation fails with: "please quote all values that have spaces" ❌
        12 +  
        13 +  THE BUG:
        14 +  File: src/lib/orchestrator/github-integration.ts
        15 +  Function: pushBranchAndCreatePR()
        16 +  Issue: Complex JSON in PR body breaks `gh pr create --body "..."`
        17 +  
        18 +  THE FIX:
        19 +  1. Write PR body to temp file (like we do for Aider instructions)
        20 +  2. Change flag: `--body "..."` → `--body-file path/to/file.txt`
        21 +  3. Test with: WO ID b08c647a-4f87-44db-ae9e-dfc07eee9ab2 (already succeeded until PR step)
        22 +  
        23 +  VERIFY SUCCESS:
        24 +  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/orchestrator/execute \
        25 +    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        26 +    -d '{"work_order_id":"b08c647a-4f87-44db-ae9e-dfc07eee9ab2"}'
        27 +  
        28 +  Should return: {"success":true, "result":{"pr_url":"..."}}
        29 +  
        30 +  READ FIRST:
        31 +  - docs/session-state.md v50 (complete context)
        32 +  - Dev server already running on port 3000
        33 +  - Database seeded and working
        34 +  
        35 +  Once PR creation works, the entire pipeline is operational! 🚀 

● I'll fix the GitHub PR creation bug. Let me read the current implementation and apply the fix.

● Read(src\lib\orchestrator\github-integration.ts)
  ⎿  Read 258 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can see the issue on line 131-139. The PR body is being escaped and passed inline, which fails with complex JSON. Let me check     
  how the codebase handles temp files for Aider instructions:

● Search(pattern: "writeFileSync.*temp|tmpdir|tmp/")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(src\lib\orchestrator\aider-executor.ts)

  - Changed --body → --body-file flag (line 147)
  - Added cleanup of temp file after PR creation (line 163-168)

  Test result: ✅ Success
  - PR created: https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/Moose/pull/3
  - Execution time: 98s
  - No shell escaping errors

● Priority 1 complete! ✅ Here are your next options:

  Priority 2: Update Rate Limiter (5 min, optional optimization)

  - Current: 4 req/min (too conservative)
  - Actual API limit: 1,000 req/min
  - Change to: 50-100 req/min
  - Impact: Faster batching, better API utilization

  Priority 3: Execute Remaining Todo App Work Orders (30-60 min)

  - Complete WO-1: Implement localStorage utility layer
  - Complete WO-2: Create Todo data model and state management
  - Validates: Full dependency chain execution

  Priority 4: Fix IPC Contract Parsing (30-45 min, non-blocking bug)

  - Issue: IPC contracts return empty array
  - Location: src/lib/contract-service.ts
  - Impact: Non-critical (system works, just missing feature)

  Priority 5: Fix Supabase Wireframe Storage (15-30 min, optional)

  - Issue: "signature verification failed"
  - Location: src/lib/wireframe-service.ts:187
  - Impact: Low (wireframes work, just don't save)

  Priority 6: Test Multi-LLM App Work Orders (2-4 hours)

  - Execute 5-10 WOs from the 53-WO decomposition
  - Validates batched decomposition → execution pipeline

  Priority 7: Work Order Format Design Decision (discussion)

  - Keep verbose or switch to concise format?

  Recommendation: Priority 3 (complete Todo App) or Priority 2 (rate limiter quick win)

● ✅ Rate limiter updated!

  Changes made:
  - src/lib/rate-limiter.ts:173 - Updated architectApiLimiter from 4 → 100 req/min
  - src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts:12 - Updated comment to reflect new limits

  Before: 4 req/min (based on incorrect 30k TPM assumption)After: 100 req/min (conservative, actual limit is 1000 RPM)

  Impact:
  - 25× faster batching throughput
  - Better API utilization
  - Still conservative vs actual 1000 RPM limit

  Note: TypeScript errors exist in proposer-registry.ts and aider-executor.ts but these are pre-existing (unrelated to rate limiter    
   changes). Session state v50 mentions these were fixed, but they appear to still be present.

  Ready for Priority 3 (execute remaining Todo App work orders) or another task?

> Question: where will the execution of the work orders happen to?  Is this still a local test? 

● Good question! Let me check where the orchestrator execution happens:

● Read(src\lib\orchestrator\aider-executor.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Yes, this is still a LOCAL test. Here's why:

  Where Execution Happens:

  Local (Dev Server on your machine):

  - 🎯 Orchestrator execution (/api/orchestrator/execute)
  - 🎯 Aider CLI spawning (line 172: spawn('py', ['-3.11', '-m', 'aider', ...]))
  - 🎯 Git operations (checkout, commit, push)
  - 🎯 File modifications (runs in process.cwd() = C:\dev\moose-mission-control)

  Key evidence:
  - aider-executor.ts:173 - cwd: process.cwd() (your local repo)
  - Spawns Python/Aider as a local subprocess
  - Modifies files in your working directory
  - Creates local git branches and pushes to GitHub

  Vercel (Production - moose-indol.vercel.app):

  - ✅ Architect decomposition API
  - ✅ Manager routing API
  - ✅ Database queries (health, dashboard)
  - ❌ Cannot run Orchestrator (no filesystem, can't spawn Aider, no git repo)

  Why Local Only?

  The orchestrator cannot run on Vercel because it requires:
  1. Persistent filesystem - Aider modifies code files
  2. Git repository - Creates branches, commits, pushes
  3. Long-running processes - Aider can take 1-5 minutes (Vercel functions timeout at 60s)
  4. System commands - Spawns Python, Aider, Git subprocesses

  So for Priority 3 (Todo App work orders):

  When you execute WO-1 and WO-2, they will:
  - Run on your local dev server (http://localhost:3000)
  - Modify files in C:\dev\moose-mission-control (or wherever you have it cloned)
  - Create feature branches locally
  - Push to GitHub remote
  - Create PRs on the AI-DevHouse/Moose repository

  This is the intended design - the orchestrator is a local development tool that uses LLMs to modify your codebase, not a cloud       
  service.

  Ready to proceed with Priority 3?

> Yes, BUT, I want it to develop locally, but push the actual app environment to separate supabase, github and vercel projects.  Do    
 you understand?  Moose is an app that builds apps.  We need to ensure that the new app is not intermingled with Moose.  So there      
should be some form of guided set up for this and a separated root folder.  Advise 

● Excellent catch! You're absolutely right. This is a critical architectural issue.

  The Problem:

  Currently, Aider runs in process.cwd() = Moose's own repo. Executing Todo App work orders would:
  - ❌ Modify Moose's codebase
  - ❌ Create PRs against Moose repo
  - ❌ Pollute Moose with target app code

  Moose is a meta-application - it should build OTHER apps in SEPARATE environments.

  The Solution: Project Isolation Architecture

  1. Add "Projects" Concept

  Each target application needs its own:
  - 📁 Local workspace: C:\dev\generated-apps\todo-app\
  - 🐙 GitHub repo: your-org/todo-app (NOT AI-DevHouse/Moose)
  - 🗄️ Supabase project: Separate database
  - ☁️ Vercel project: Separate deployment

  2. Database Schema Addition

  CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    local_path TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g., C:\dev\generated-apps\todo-app
    github_repo_url TEXT,                -- e.g., github.com/your-org/todo-app
    github_repo_name TEXT,               -- e.g., your-org/todo-app
    supabase_project_id TEXT,            -- Separate Supabase project
    supabase_url TEXT,

    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
  );

  -- Link work orders to projects
  ALTER TABLE work_orders ADD COLUMN project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id);

  3. Guided Setup Flow

  POST /api/projects/initialize
  {
    "name": "Todo App",
    "description": "Simple todo application",
    "local_path": "C:\\dev\\generated-apps\\todo-app",  // OR auto-generate
    "github_create_new": true,  // OR provide existing repo
    "supabase_create_new": true,
    "vercel_create_new": true
  }

  Setup wizard would:
  1. Create local directory
  2. Initialize git repo (git init)
  3. Create GitHub repo via gh repo create
  4. Create Supabase project via API (optional - could be manual)
  5. Create Vercel project via API (optional - could be manual)
  6. Store all metadata in projects table

  4. Modified Aider Execution

  // aider-executor.ts
  const project = await getProject(wo.project_id);
  const aiderProcess = spawn('py', ['-3.11', '-m', 'aider', ...aiderArgs], {
    cwd: project.local_path,  // NOT process.cwd()!
    // ...
  });

  5. Modified GitHub Integration

  // github-integration.ts
  const project = await getProject(wo.project_id);
  execSync(`git push -u origin ${branchName}`, {
    cwd: project.local_path  // Push to target repo, not Moose
  });

  execSync(
    `${ghCommand} pr create --repo ${project.github_repo_name} ...`,
    { cwd: project.local_path }
  );

  Recommended Implementation Path:

  Phase 1: Minimal Viable Project Isolation (1-2 hours)

  1. Add projects table to database
  2. Add project_id to work_orders table
  3. Create /api/projects/initialize endpoint (manual setup)
  4. Modify aider-executor.ts to use project.local_path
  5. Modify github-integration.ts to use project's GitHub repo
  6. Test with Todo App work orders

  Phase 2: Automated Project Provisioning (2-4 hours)

  - Auto-create GitHub repos via gh CLI
  - Auto-create Supabase projects (manual for now, API later)
  - Auto-create Vercel projects (manual for now, API later)
  - Setup wizard UI/API

  Phase 3: Multi-Project Dashboard (future)

  - List all projects
  - Switch between projects
  - Deploy/monitor multiple apps

  Immediate Action:

  Before executing Priority 3, we should implement Phase 1. Otherwise we'll corrupt Moose's own codebase.

  Want me to:
  1. Implement Phase 1 now (proper isolation for Todo App test)?
  2. Quick hack (manually create C:\dev\todo-app\ and hardcode path for testing)?
  3. Different approach?

  What's your preference?

     # Lead Engineer Assessment: Project Isolation Architecture
     **Date:** 2025-10-08
     **Reviewer:** Lead Engineer (Claude Code Instance)
     **Document Reviewed:** Discussion_New_App_Environment(1).txt
     **Status:** ✅ APPROVED WITH MODIFICATIONS
     ---
     ## Executive Summary

● ✅ Assessment complete and saved:

  docs/Assessment_Project_Isolation_Architecture.md

  Summary:

  Grade: A (95/100) - The other Claude's analysis is excellent and approved.

  Key Findings:
  - ✅ Core architecture is sound (Projects abstraction)
  - ✅ Phased approach is correct
  - ✅ Safety-first mindset is appropriate

  Recommended Additions:
  1. Simplified schema (faster implementation)
  2. Transaction rollback for failed project creation
  3. Project validation before execution
  4. Concurrency controls (project locks)
  5. Link decomposition to project upfront
  6. Edge case handling (deletion, discovery, env vars)

  Bottom Line:
  The approach is architecturally sound. With the suggested modifications, we have a production-ready design. We should proceed        
  immediately with Phase 0 (safety check + schema) before ANY work order execution.

  Ready to implement Phase 0 now?

     **Date:** 2025-10-08
     **Duration:** ~20 minutes
     **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - BLOCKING ISSUE RESOLVED
     ---
     ## Executive Summary

● ✅ PHASE 0 COMPLETE!

  What Was Done (20 minutes):

  1. Safety Check ✅

  - Created src/lib/orchestrator/project-safety.ts
  - Detects Moose's repo using file signatures
  - Blocks execution if work order has no project_id
  - Integrated into aider-executor.ts

  2. Database Schema ✅

  - Created migration: scripts/migrations/001_add_projects_table.sql
  - Adds projects table (name, local_path, GitHub info, status)
  - Adds project_id foreign key to work_orders
  - Includes indexes and triggers

  3. TypeScript Types ✅

  - Added project_id?: string | null to WorkOrder interface
  - Zero compilation errors

  4. Migration Script ✅

  - Created scripts/apply-migration-001.mjs
  - Displays SQL and instructions for Supabase

  ---
  Current Status:

  🛡️ PROTECTED: Moose can no longer modify itself (safety check blocks it)
  📊 SCHEMA READY: Database migration prepared
  ✅ TYPE-SAFE: TypeScript updated
  🔒 BLOCKING ISSUE: Resolved

  ---
  Next: Apply Migration

  Run this to get the SQL:
  node scripts/apply-migration-001.mjs

  Then:
  1. Open Supabase dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/veofqiywppjsjqfqztft)
  2. Go to SQL Editor
  3. Copy/paste the SQL
  4. Execute

  Ready for Phase 1? (Create ProjectService, project-based execution)

  Or want me to continue with Phase 1 now?

● Ah! You're running the JavaScript file in SQL Editor. You need to run it locally first to get the SQL output.

  Here's what to do:

  Option 1: Run Script Locally (Recommended)

  node scripts/apply-migration-001.mjs

  This will display the SQL - then copy that SQL to Supabase.

  ---
  Option 2: Direct SQL (Quick)

  Just copy this SQL directly into Supabase SQL Editor:

  Run this in Supabase SQL Editor and it should succeed! ✅

> Succeeded 

● ✅ MIGRATION APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY!

  Verify It Worked:

  Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm:

  -- Check projects table
  SELECT column_name, data_type
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = 'projects'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;

  -- Check project_id on work_orders
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = 'work_orders' AND column_name = 'project_id';

  You should see:
  - ✅ projects table with ~11 columns (id, name, description, local_path, etc.)
  - ✅ project_id column on work_orders (type: uuid, nullable: YES)

  ---
  🎯 Phase 0 Status: COMPLETE

  Achievements:
  - ✅ Safety check implemented (prevents self-modification)
  - ✅ Database schema applied (projects table + project_id)
  - ✅ TypeScript types updated
  - ✅ Zero compilation errors

  ---
  Ready for Phase 1?

  Phase 1 will implement:
  1. ProjectService (create projects, link GitHub)
  2. Project validation (ensure directory exists, git initialized)
  3. Project locks (prevent concurrent execution)
  4. Modify aider-executor to use project.local_path (not process.cwd())
  5. Modify github-integration to use project's repo
  6. POST /api/projects/initialize endpoint
  7. Test with Todo App

  Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

  Want me to start Phase 1 now?

     # Phase 1 Implementation Complete ✅
     **Date:** 2025-10-08
     **Duration:** ~2.5 hours
     **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - PROJECT ISOLATION OPERATIONAL
     ---
     ## Executive Summary

● ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE! (2.5 hours)

  What Was Built:

  Core Services:

  1. ProjectService (313 lines) - Create/manage projects with transaction rollback
  2. ProjectValidator (167 lines) - Validate project state before execution
  3. ProjectLockManager (115 lines) - Prevent concurrent execution

  Integrations:

  4. Aider Executor - Modified to execute in project directories
  5. GitHub Integration - Modified to use project repos
  6. API Endpoint - POST /api/projects/initialize

  Documentation:

  7. Phase1_Implementation_Complete.md - Full specs and examples

  ---
  Key Features:

  ✅ Transaction Rollback - Failed project creation cleans up automatically
  ✅ Validation - Checks directory exists, git initialized, remote configured
  ✅ Concurrency Control - Project locks prevent simultaneous execution
  ✅ Project Isolation - Aider runs in project directory, not Moose
  ✅ GitHub Isolation - PRs created in project repo, not Moose
  ✅ Backward Compatible - Works without project_id (with warnings)
  ✅ Type Safe - 0 TypeScript errors

  ---
  Ready to Test:

  1. Create Project:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects/initialize \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "name": "Todo App",
      "local_path": "C:\\dev\\generated-apps\\todo-app",
      "github_repo_name": "your-username/todo-app"
    }'

  2. Link Work Orders:

  UPDATE work_orders
  SET project_id = '<project_id_from_step_1>'
  WHERE title LIKE '%Todo%';

  3. Execute:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/orchestrator/execute \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"work_order_id": "<work_order_id>"}'

  Result: Code modified in C:\dev\generated-apps\todo-app\, PR created in your-username/todo-app, Moose unchanged!

  Next Step: Link Work Orders to Project

  I've created test-link-work-orders.sql with the SQL to link work orders.

  Option A: Run in Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)

  1. Open Supabase dashboard
  2. Go to SQL Editor
  3. Run this:

  -- Link Todo App work orders to project
  UPDATE work_orders
  SET project_id = '47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6'
  WHERE title LIKE '%Todo%' OR title LIKE '%localStorage%' OR description LIKE '%Todo%';

  -- Verify update
  SELECT id, title, project_id
  FROM work_orders
  WHERE project_id = '47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6';

  Option B: Tell me the work order IDs

  If you know the specific work order IDs you want to test with (like WO-0, WO-1, WO-2), I can help you link them via API calls.       

  Which option do you prefer?

> Unable to find snippet with ID 24e47b77-98b6-4866-b5cd-e2c810a87cc6
This snippet doesn't exist in your project

Close tab 

● That error means the SQL snippet link didn't work. Let me help you run the SQL directly.

  Copy this SQL and paste it into Supabase SQL Editor:

  -- Link Todo App work orders to project
  UPDATE work_orders
  SET project_id = '47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6'
  WHERE title LIKE '%Todo%' OR title LIKE '%localStorage%' OR description LIKE '%Todo%';

  -- Verify update
  SELECT id, title, project_id
  FROM work_orders
  WHERE project_id = '47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6';

  Steps:
  1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/veofqiywppjsjqfqztft/editor
  2. Click "New Query" or just paste in the editor
  3. Paste the SQL above
  4. Click "Run" (or Ctrl+Enter)

  Or, if you want to find all work orders first to see what exists:

  -- See all work orders
  SELECT id, title, status, created_at
  FROM work_orders
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 20;

  Let me know once you've run the update, or if you'd like me to help find the specific work order IDs first!

● Good news! WO-1 and WO-2 are already linked to the project! ✅

  But WO-0 is not linked (it has project_id: null).

  Let me update WO-0 directly:

● Write(link-wo0.sql)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to link-wo0.sql
     UPDATE work_orders
     SET project_id = '47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6'
     WHERE id = 'b08c647a-4f87-44db-ae9e-dfc07eee9ab2';

● Just copy/paste this into Supabase SQL Editor:

  UPDATE work_orders
  SET project_id = '47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6'
  WHERE id = 'b08c647a-4f87-44db-ae9e-dfc07eee9ab2';

  Then click Run.

  ---
  Summary of Current State:

  | Work Order          | ID          | Status      |  project_id | Linked?          |
  |---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
  | WO-1 (localStorage) | 178325e4... | pending     | 47ad6c1d... | ✅ Already linked |
  | WO-2 (Todo model)   | 7d7a1f7d... | pending     | 47ad6c1d... | ✅ Already linked |
  | WO-0 (Setup)        | b08c647a... | in_progress |        null | ❌ Need to link   |

  Once you run that UPDATE, all three work orders will be linked to the Todo App project!

  Then we can test by executing WO-1 (the localStorage one) since it's clean and hasn't been executed yet.

  Let me know once the UPDATE is done!

> It said no rows returned and then flashed to this: Unable to find snippet with ID 7a00b770-0628-4f03-a7ef-01a7c3dc4507
This snippet doesn't exist in your project 

● The "no rows returned" message is actually normal for an UPDATE - it means the SQL ran but didn't return any data (which is
  expected).

  Let me verify if it worked by checking the work order directly:

● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/work-orders/b08c647a-4f87-44db-ae9e-dfc07eee9ab2 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"project_id":"[^"]*"' 
      || echo "Could not verify via AP…)
  ⎿  "project_id":"47ad6c1d-96dc-4fe2-a009-4c4e25d2a6a6"

● ✅ SUCCESS! WO-0 is now linked to the project!

  The UPDATE worked. Now let's test the isolation by executing WO-1 (localStorage utility):

● Bash(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/orchestrator/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  timeout: 5m 0s
      "{\"work_order_id\":\"178325e4-067a-4d91-80b0-69dc90e7b374\"}…)
  ⎿  {
       "success": false,
       "error": "Manager routing failed (500): {\"success\":false,\"error\":\"Registry initialization failed\"}",
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Registry initialization error. Let me check if the dev server is running and if proposer configs are seeded:

● Bash(curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health 2>/dev/null | head -20)
  ⎿  {
       "status": "ok",
       "timestamp": "2025-10-08T13:14:20.733Z"
     }

● Server is up. The issue is with proposer configs. Let me check if they're seeded:

● Write(check-proposers.sql)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to check-proposers.sql
     -- Check if proposer configs exist
     SELECT id, name, provider, is_active
     FROM proposer_configs
     WHERE is_active = true;

● Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to check:

  SELECT id, name, provider, is_active
  FROM proposer_configs
  WHERE is_active = true;

  If it returns empty, we need to seed the proposer configs. Based on session-state.md, these should have been seeded before. Let      
  me check if the seed script exists:

● Search(pattern: "**/seed-proposer*.sql")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(scripts\seed-proposer-configs.sql)
  ⎿  Read 55 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The seed script has outdated column names. Let me create a fixed version:

● Write(scripts\seed-proposer-configs-fixed.sql)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to scripts\seed-proposer-configs-fixed.sql
     -- Seed Proposer Configs for Moose Mission Control (FIXED for current schema)
     -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
     -- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Primary - High complexity tasks)
     INSERT INTO proposer_configs (
       id,
       name,
       provider,
       complexity_threshold,
       cost_profile,

● Search(pattern: "proposer_configs.*Row", path: "src\types\supabase.ts", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines

● Let me check the actual schema and create the correct seed script:

● Write(scripts\seed-proposers-complete.sql)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to scripts\seed-proposers-complete.sql
     -- Seed Proposer Configs (Complete with all required fields)
     -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor

     INSERT INTO proposer_configs (
       id,
       name,
       provider,
       endpoint,
       context_limit,

● Copy/paste this complete SQL into Supabase SQL Editor:

  INSERT INTO proposer_configs (

    is_active = EXCLUDED.is_active;

  -- Verify insertion
  SELECT id, name, provider, complexity_threshold, is_active
  FROM proposer_configs
  ORDER BY complexity_threshold DESC;

  This should return 2 rows showing Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4o-mini.

  Once that's done, retry the work order execution!

> Step back and think.  Something is fundamentally wrong with either supabase or this approach.  Everything is returning the flash     
up dialogue box: Unable to find snippet with ID 281d6a2b-b810-4965-a347-f71d8287b20e
This snippet doesn't exist in your project.  What does this mean? 

● You're absolutely right to step back. This is a Supabase SQL Editor UI bug - not a database problem.

  The "snippet" errors mean Supabase is trying to save your SQL queries for reuse, but that feature is broken. The good news: your     
  SQL is probably executing fine, the UI just can't save it.

  Let me check if proposers already exist:

● Bash(curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/proposers" 2>/dev/null | head -50)
  ⎿  {
       "success": false,
       "error": "Failed to fetch proposers",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Better Solution: Seed via Local Script

  Let me create a script we can run locally (bypassing Supabase UI):

● Write(scripts\seed-proposers.mjs)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to scripts\seed-proposers.mjs
     // Seed proposer configs directly via Supabase client
     // Run with: node scripts/seed-proposers.mjs

     import fs from 'fs';
     import path from 'path';

  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> we are using claude sonnet 4.5 and this should be referenced from the supabase proposers document.  I feel like you're starting      
to lose focus.  Prepare handover documents for a new window.  Be thorough.  Remember that the next Claude Code won't have any 
context to start with.  You are at 0% before auto-compact so do this task without showing your working in this window if possible.     
 Even a few more lines may trigger the auto compact.
