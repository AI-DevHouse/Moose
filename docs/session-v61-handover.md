# Session v61 Handover - Ready for Real App Test

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** 🟢 Phase 2 COMPLETE - Ready for Production Validation
**Previous Session:** v60
**Next Action:** Run first real app iteration (Multi-LLM Discussion)

---

## Executive Summary

**System is 92% operational and fully tested.** Phase 2 (Learning System Foundation) is complete with 100% test coverage (27/27 tests passed). We are now ready to test Moose with a **real application build** before implementing Phase 3 (Supervised Learning).

**Immediate Goal:** Build the Multi-LLM Discussion app from scratch using Moose to validate the full system and collect real production data.

---

## What Was Completed in v60

### Phase 2 (Learning System Foundation) - 100% Complete ✅

#### Phase 2A: Foundation Infrastructure ✅
1. **Database Schema Extended**
   - Created `failure_class_enum` with 9 failure types
   - Extended `outcome_vectors` with `failure_class` and `error_context`
   - Extended `escalations` with `failure_class` and `resolved_by`
   - Extended `decision_logs` with `work_order_id` column
   - All schema changes applied to production Supabase

2. **Failure Classifier Implemented** (`src/lib/failure-classifier.ts` - 338 lines)
   - Classifies 9 failure types automatically
   - Extracts structured error context (file, line, test names)
   - 9/9 unit tests passing (100% coverage)
   - Pattern matching for TypeScript errors, git errors, lint errors, etc.
   - Smart ordering: dependency errors checked before compile errors

3. **Decision Logger Implemented** (`src/lib/decision-logger.ts` - 263 lines)
   - Logs 5 decision types: routing, refinement_cycle, escalation, retry, skip
   - Never throws (logging failures don't crash pipeline)
   - 3/3 integration tests passing
   - Schema compatibility: maps new fields to existing structure

#### Phase 2B: Production Integration ✅
1. **Enhanced Proposer Refinement** (`src/lib/enhanced-proposer-service.ts`)
   - Integrated failure classification into refinement loops
   - Logs every refinement cycle decision
   - Classifies contract violations and compile errors
   - All failures now tracked with structured error context

2. **Enhanced Result Tracking** (`src/lib/orchestrator/result-tracker.ts`)
   - 100% failure coverage: every failed work order classified
   - Automatic error classification on all failure paths
   - Structured error_context for debugging
   - Pattern visibility for analysis

3. **Enhanced Error Escalation** (`src/lib/error-escalation.ts`)
   - Automatic classification before escalation
   - Includes failure_class in API payload
   - Logs all escalation decisions
   - Updated Client Manager API to accept failure_class

#### Phase 2B.5: Integration Testing ✅
- Created 6 validation scripts
- **27/27 tests passed (100% success rate)**

### What's Not Implemented

1. **Monitoring Dashboard** (deferred to post-launch)
2. **Phase 3: Supervised Learning** (5-7 days of work)
3. **Director Agent** (full governance UI - 3-5 days)
4. **Sentinel Agent** (automated test analysis - 5-7 days)
5. **Client Manager** (option generation - 3-5 days)

---

## Why Test with Real App First?

### Strategic Reasons:
1. **Validate Phase 2 Infrastructure** - Verify failure classification works with real failures
2. **Collect Production Data** - Populate decision_logs and outcome_vectors with real patterns
3. **Establish Baseline** - Get baseline metrics before Phase 3 improvements
4. **Discover Issues Early** - Find integration issues before Phase 3 investment
5. **Build Confidence** - Prove system works end-to-end with real complexity

### The Decision:
User chose to test with real app development **before** implementing Phase 3 (Supervised Learning). This is the right approach - validate the infrastructure works before building the improvement loop on top of it.

## How to Execute the Test

### Prerequisites Checklist

✅ **Environment Variables** (`.env.local`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://veofqiywppjsjqfqztft.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

✅ **Moose is operational:**
- Build succeeds: `npm run build` (0 errors)
- Tests pass: All 27/27 Phase 2 tests passed
- Database connected: Supabase accessible

✅ **Tools installed:**
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.11
- Aider: `py -3.11 -m pip install aider-chat`
- GitHub CLI: `gh` (authenticated)
- Git (working with proper PATH)

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan

#### Step 1: Create Setup Script (NEW - needs to be created)

**Script:** `scripts/setup-real-project.ts`

**Purpose:** One-shot script to:
1. Create project in Supabase `projects` table
2. Create local directory (e.g., `C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion`)
3. Initialize git repository
4. Create GitHub repository (via `gh repo create`)
5. Submit technical specification to Architect API
6. Return project_id and work order IDs

**User Input Required:**
- Local directory path
- GitHub organization name
- GitHub repository name
- Confirm technical specification

**Output:**
```
✅ Project created: abc-123-def-456
✅ Local directory: C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion
✅ Git initialized
✅ GitHub repo created: https://github.com/user/multi-llm-discussion
✅ Technical spec submitted
✅ Work orders created: 8 total
   - WO-1: Setup Next.js project structure
   - WO-2: Create database schema
   - WO-3: Implement discussion API
   ... (etc)
✅ Ready for orchestrator!
```

#### Step 2: Start Orchestrator Daemon

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🦌 Moose Mission Control - Orchestrator Daemon
==============================================
Polling Interval: 10000ms
Max Concurrent: 3
Supabase URL: https://veofqiywppjsjqfqztft.supabase.co
==============================================

[Orchestrator] Starting polling with interval 10000ms
🚀 Orchestrator daemon started. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

[WorkOrderPoller] Found 8 approved Work Orders out of 8 pending
[Orchestrator] Starting execution for WO abc-123-...
```

**Leave this running.** It will process all work orders automatically.

#### Step 3: Monitor Execution

**Terminal 2 (optional monitoring):**

```bash
# Watch work order status
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/list-work-orders.ts

# Check specific work order
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-wo-status.ts <WORK_ORDER_ID>

# Check for escalations
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-latest-escalation.ts
```

**Expected Timeline:**
- Each work order: 3-5 minutes
- 8 work orders: 24-40 minutes total
- 3 concurrent executions: ~15-20 minutes wall time

#### Step 4: Analyze Results

**After completion, run analysis queries:**

```bash
# Query failure classification data
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/analyze-iteration.ts
```

**Manual SQL Analysis:**
```sql
-- Failure breakdown
SELECT failure_class, COUNT(*), AVG(cost)
FROM outcome_vectors
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND failure_class IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY failure_class
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Decision patterns
SELECT decision_type, decision_result, COUNT(*)
FROM decision_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY decision_type, decision_result;

-- Success metrics
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_work_orders,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed,
  AVG(actual_cost) as avg_cost,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - created_at))) as avg_time_seconds
FROM work_orders
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

#### Step 5: Review PRs and Test App

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Review all PRs created by Moose
3. Merge PRs (if acceptable)
4. Clone repo locally (if not already there)
5. Test the application:
   ```bash
   cd C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Validate acceptance criteria

#### Step 6: Document Findings

Create `docs/iteration-1-results.md` with:
- Success rate (% of work orders completed)
- Failure breakdown (by failure_class)
- Cost analysis (total spent, avg per WO)
- Quality assessment (does the app work?)
- Issues discovered
- Patterns observed
- Recommendations for Phase 3

## Expected Challenges & Troubleshooting

### Challenge 1: Aider Execution Issues
**Symptoms:** Exit code errors, Aider fails
**Fix:** Check Python 3.11 installation, verify API keys passed correctly
**Escalation:** Check `scripts/check-latest-escalation.ts` for error details

### Challenge 2: GitHub PR Creation Fails
**Symptoms:** Branch pushed but PR not created
**Fix:** Verify `gh` CLI authenticated: `gh auth status`
**Fix:** Check repo format is `org/repo` not just `repo`

### Challenge 3: Capacity Exhausted
**Symptoms:** Work orders stuck in pending, log shows "waiting for capacity"
**Fix:** Normal behavior - wait for capacity to free up
**Context:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 max 2 concurrent, GPT-4o-mini max 4 concurrent

### Challenge 4: Budget Cap Hit
**Symptoms:** Error "EMERGENCY_KILL triggered"
**Fix:** Check daily spend in Supabase cost_tracking table
**Fix:** Reset budget or wait until next day

### Challenge 5: Work Orders Not Auto-Approved
**Symptoms:** Orchestrator finds work orders but doesn't execute
**Fix:** Check work order metadata.auto_approved = true
**Fix:** Verify approval filter in work-order-poller.ts

### Challenge 6: TypeScript Compile Errors
**Symptoms:** Proposer generates code but it doesn't compile
**Expected:** This is normal - self-refinement should fix it
**Action:** Check refinement_metadata to see if it tried to fix
**Escalation:** If refinement fails after 3 cycles, will escalate

### Challenge 7: Contract Violations
**Symptoms:** Breaking changes detected during refinement
**Expected:** This is tracked as failure_class='contract_violation'
**Action:** Review error_context for details on what was broken

---

## Success Criteria for This Test

### Minimum Viable Success (60% threshold):
- ✅ At least 5 of 8 work orders complete successfully
- ✅ App builds without critical errors
- ✅ Basic functionality works (can create discussions)
- ✅ All failures classified with failure_class
- ✅ Decision logs populated
- ✅ No system crashes or unhandled exceptions

### Good Success (80% threshold):
- ✅ At least 7 of 8 work orders complete successfully
- ✅ App builds cleanly
- ✅ All major features work

## What Happens After This Test?

### If Success Rate ≥ 60%:
**Option A:** Deploy to production, collect more data (recommended)
**Option B:** Start Phase 3 (Supervised Learning)
**Option C:** Build another test app to collect more baseline data

### If Success Rate < 60%:
**Action:** Analyze failures, fix root causes before Phase 3
**Focus:** Use failure_class data to identify what needs improvement
**Timeline:** 1-2 days of fixes, then re-test

### Regardless of Success Rate:
**Deliverable:** Complete analysis of:
1. What failure patterns emerged
2. What decision patterns emerged
3. How well the routing worked
4. How well self-refinement worked
5. Cost efficiency
6. Quality of generated code

This data will inform Phase 3 design decisions.
