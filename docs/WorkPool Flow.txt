● Phase 2 Integration Complete ✅

  Successfully integrated the worktree pool with orchestrator, aider, and GitHub components. All code compiles without errors.

  Changes Summary:

  1. Environment Configuration (.env.local)

  WORKTREE_POOL_ENABLED=true
  WORKTREE_POOL_SIZE=3
  WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=true
  ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS=3

  2. Orchestrator Service (orchestrator-service.ts:16-500)

  - Imported WorktreePoolManager and WorktreeHandle types
  - startPolling(): Initializes worktree pool with 3 worktrees on startup
  - stopPolling(): Cleans up worktree pool on shutdown
  - executeWorkOrder():
    - Leases worktree before Aider execution
    - Passes worktreeHandle.path to both executeAider() and pushBranchAndCreatePR()
    - Releases worktree in finally block (guaranteed cleanup)

  3. Aider Executor (aider-executor.ts:174)

  - Added optional worktreePath?: string parameter to executeAider()
  - Uses worktree path if provided, otherwise falls back to project path
  - All git operations execute in worktree directory when pool enabled

  4. GitHub Integration (github-integration.ts:111)

  - Added optional worktreePath?: string parameter to pushBranchAndCreatePR()
  - Uses worktree path for git push/PR operations
  - Still fetches repo name from project metadata

  Architecture Flow:

  1. Orchestrator starts → Initialize 3 worktrees (pool size from env)
  2. WO arrives → Lease worktree (blocks if pool exhausted)
  3. Execute Aider → Use worktree path (isolated execution)
  4. Create PR → Push from worktree (no conflicts)
  5. Validate acceptance → Run tests in worktree
  6. Finally → Release worktree (cleanup, reset to main, return to pool)

  Key Benefits:

  - Zero file-level race conditions: Each WO gets dedicated directory
  - Automatic cleanup: Worktrees reset to main, branches deleted, changes discarded
  - Blocking queue: WOs wait gracefully when pool exhausted
  - Backward compatible: Falls back to shared directory if pool disabled

  Ready for Testing:

  The system is now ready to run with the worktree pool. The configuration is set for 3 concurrent WOs with 3 worktrees. To test:

  # Start orchestrator (will initialize worktree pool automatically)
  powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts

  # Monitor logs for pool initialization and lease/release cycles

  Should I proceed with creating test work orders to validate the end-to-end flow?
