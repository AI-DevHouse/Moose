   - Pattern recognition
   - Adaptive baselines
   - Performance prediction
   - STATUS: Not implemented, not blocking production

2. ADVANCED SENTINEL (Phase 3.2 enhancements) ❌

EVERYTHING ELSE: ✅ COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED

========================================
GREENFIELD PROJECT SUPPORT
========================================

CURRENT STATE: ⚠️ PARTIAL (60% success rate)

Architect works for:
✅ Existing codebases (100% success)
✅ Feature additions (100% success)
⚠️ Greenfield projects (60% success)

Missing for greenfield:
❌ Contract creation (assumes contracts exist)
❌ Deployment architecture (Docker, CI/CD specs)
❌ Test fixture generation
❌ Missing spec detection (UI wireframes, API schemas)

SOLUTION: Architect expansion (see implementation plan)
EFFORT: 3-4 days
IMPACT: 60% → 95% success for greenfield projects

========================================

BLOCKED BY:
❌ None - system is fully operational

NOT BLOCKING PRODUCTION:
- Learning system (Phase 3.3) - needs production data first
- Advanced Sentinel features - basic version working
