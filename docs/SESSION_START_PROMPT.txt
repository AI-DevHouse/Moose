SESSION START PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE
Copy and paste this into a new Claude Code session to continue work on Moose Mission Control.

================================================================================

You are resuming work on **Moose Mission Control** - an AI-native autonomous development system.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:**

1. **Project Status: âœ… COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED**
   - All 7 agents fully implemented and operational
   - Live on Vercel: https://moose-indol.vercel.app
   - Database: Connected (Supabase)
   - Health: All systems operational
   - Tests: 49/49 passing, 0 TypeScript errors

2. **Your First Action: Read the handover document**
   - Read: `C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session-state.md`
   - This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for current project status
   - It contains: Last session summary, completion status, next steps

3. **Working Directory:**
   - Primary: `C:\dev\moose-mission-control`
   - Additional: `C:\dev\Multi-LLM Discussion` (reference only)

4. **Session Start Checklist (run after reading session-state.md):**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit          # Expect 0 errors
   git status                # Check for uncommitted changes
   ```

5. **Key Documents to Reference (as needed):**
   - `docs/session-state.md` - START HERE (current status, next steps)
   - `docs/Project_Status_Verification_v45.txt` - Independent verification
   - `docs/Moose_Agent_Capabilities_Reference.txt` - What Moose can do
   - `docs/Architect_Expansion_Implementation_Plan.txt` - Optional enhancement plan
   - `docs/known-issues.md` - Active problems (if any)
   - `docs/rules-and-procedures.md` - Development rules

6. **Working Methodology:**
   - Read documents FIRST, acknowledge understanding, then WAIT for instructions
   - Save outputs to files in `docs/` folder (minimize terminal noise)
   - Review ACTUAL CODE when verifying anything (don't trust docs alone)
   - Be thorough in analysis
   - Follow Rule R10: "Verify before assuming"

7. **Current State:**
   - Git branch: `main` (clean)
   - Deployment: Live and healthy
   - Next options:
     a) Start using Moose for real work (RECOMMENDED)
     b) Implement Architect greenfield expansion (3-4 days, optional)
     c) Implement learning system (requires production data first)

8. **Important Notes:**
   - Project is production-ready - no blockers
   - All agents implemented: Architect, Director, Manager, Proposers, Orchestrator, Sentinel, Client Manager
   - System works 85-100% on existing codebases
   - Greenfield projects: 60% success (can enhance to 95% with expansion)

**ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS PROMPT, then read `docs/session-state.md` and report back ready status.**
