> I can see the list of work orders and the columns - are the instructions only what's in the description column?  Does our system test the completed 
proposer code against the acceptance criteria? 

‚óè Great questions! Let me clarify both:

  1. Instructions to Proposer (Multiple Columns)

  The proposer receives MORE than just the description:

  What the proposer gets:
  // From work_orders table:
  - title                    // "Add TypeScript strict mode configuration"
  - description              // Full description paragraph
  - acceptance_criteria[]    // Array of specific requirements
  - complexity_score         // 1-10 rating
  - files_to_modify[]        // Target files (if specified)

  // Additional context added by system:
  - Project file tree        // Full directory structure
  - Dependency analysis      // External packages detected
  - Routing decision         // Why this proposer was chosen
  - Contract/wireframe       // If applicable

  Example from system prompt:
  Work Order: [title]

  Description:
  [description]

  Acceptance Criteria:
  1. [criterion 1]
  2. [criterion 2]
  3. [criterion 3]

  Project Context:
  [file tree, dependencies, etc.]

  Generate production-ready code that satisfies ALL acceptance criteria.

  So yes, acceptance_criteria is a separate column (text array) that gets passed to the proposer.

  2. Testing Against Acceptance Criteria (CRITICAL GAP)

  Short answer: NO - The system does NOT validate the code against acceptance criteria semantically.

  What the System Actually Tests

  Acceptance Validator (src/lib/acceptance-validator.ts) only checks:

  1. Build Success (0/10 in v107)
    - Runs npm run build
    - Pass/fail based on exit code
  2. Test Success
    - Runs npm test
    - Pass/fail based on exit code
  3. TypeScript Errors
    - Counts TS errors from build output
  4. Lint Errors
    - Counts ESLint errors
  5. TODO Count
    - Searches for TODO/FIXME comments
  6. Test Coverage
    - Parses coverage report percentage

  What It DOESN'T Test

  ‚ùå Semantic verification - Doesn't check if code actually satisfies acceptance criteria
  ‚ùå Functional correctness - Doesn't run integration tests specific to the WO
  ‚ùå Acceptance criteria checklist - Doesn't verify each criterion is met

  Example of the Gap

  Acceptance Criteria:
  1. ‚úÖ tsconfig.json has "strict": true enabled
  2. ‚ùå All strict mode sub-options are explicitly configured  ‚Üê Not checked
  3. ‚ùå No TypeScript errors after enabling ‚Üê Checked (build success)
  4. ‚úÖ Build passes successfully ‚Üê Checked
  5. ‚ùå Existing tests continue to pass ‚Üê Checked

  Current validation only checks #3, #4, #5 (automated checks)
  It doesn't verify #1, #2 (semantic requirements)

  ---
  This Is Why Quality Is Low

  The proposer is told:
  "Generate code that satisfies ALL acceptance criteria"

  But it knows:
  - It won't be tested against those criteria
  - Only automated checks run (build, tests, lint)
  - It can generate incomplete code and still "pass" if builds succeed

  What Should Happen (Phase 2 Goal)

  Option A: Enhanced Validation
  - Parse acceptance criteria
  - Generate test cases from criteria
  - Run verification against each criterion
  - Score based on how many criteria are satisfied

  Option B: LLM-Based Review
  - Have Claude review the generated code
  - Check each acceptance criterion programmatically
  - Return detailed pass/fail for each criterion
  - This would be part of the "supervised learning" loop

  Option C: Human Review
  - Current system marks WOs as "needs_review" if score <7/10
  - Human reviews PR and verifies acceptance criteria manually
  - Provides feedback for learning

  For Your Training Approach

  This gap is actually very important for training:

  Current problem:
  - gpt-4o-mini generates incomplete code
  - System only checks "does it build?" not "does it work?"
  - No feedback on whether acceptance criteria were met

  Training improvement:
  You could add a training objective:
  - Generate tests from acceptance criteria
  - Verify code against those tests
  - Score based on test pass rate

  This would force the model to:
  1. Actually read and understand acceptance criteria
  2. Generate complete implementations that pass those tests
  3. Get real feedback on functional correctness

  Would you like me to look at the actual acceptance_criteria values in the database to see what kind of requirements are being specified?

> yes 

‚óè I'll query the database to show you actual acceptance_criteria examples from the work orders:

‚óè Write(scripts\show-acceptance-criteria.ts)
  ‚éø  Wrote 1 lines to scripts\show-acceptance-criteria.ts
     import { config } from 'dotenv'
     import { resolve } from 'path'
     import { createSupabaseServiceClient } from '../src/lib/supabase'
     config({ path: resolve(__dirname, '../.env.local') })
     async function showAcceptanceCriteria() {
       const supabase = createSupabaseServiceClient()
       console.log('üìã Work Order Acceptance Criteria Examples\n')

‚óè Bash(powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/show-acceptance-criteria.ts) timeout: 30s
  ‚éø  [dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (0) from .env.local -- tip: ‚öôÔ∏è  load multiple .env files with { path: ['.env.local', '.env'] }
     üìã Work Order Acceptance Criteria Examples
     ‚Ä¶ +189 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Excellent! Now I can see the actual acceptance criteria. Let me analyze what we're looking at:

  Key Observations

  1. Acceptance Criteria Are Well-Structured

  All 10 WOs have:
  - 3-4 specific, testable criteria each
  - Clear, actionable requirements
  - Focused scope (not vague)

  Examples:
  "Add .editorconfig for consistent formatting"
  1. .editorconfig exists ‚Üê File existence check
  2. Indent rules are configured ‚Üê Content check
  3. Line ending rules are set ‚Üê Content check

  2. Most Criteria Are Automatically Verifiable

  Looking at these, I can categorize them:

  ‚úÖ Can be automatically checked:
  - File existence (.editorconfig exists, CONTRIBUTING.md exists)
  - Config values (.prettierrc is added, strict mode is enabled)
  - Code quality (No type errors in codebase)
  - Error handling presence (All API endpoints have error handling)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to automatically verify:
  - Semantic correctness (Coding standards are documented - need NLP)
  - Quality of documentation (Flow is explained clearly - subjective)
  - Proper implementation (Parser correctly identifies... - needs functional tests)

  3. The Gap Between Criteria and Validation

  What proposer was supposed to do:
  // WO: "Add TypeScript strict mode configuration"
  // Criteria:
  // 1. TypeScript strict mode is enabled
  // 2. No type errors in codebase
  // 3. Change is documented

  What proposer actually did (3.3/10 score):
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true
      // TODO: Add other strict options
    }
  }

  What current validator checks:
  - ‚úÖ Does it build? ‚Üí YES (because TODO doesn't break builds)
  - ‚ùå Is criterion #1 met? ‚Üí NOT CHECKED
  - ‚ùå Is criterion #2 met? ‚Üí NOT CHECKED (build passed, but incomplete)
  - ‚ùå Is criterion #3 met? ‚Üí NOT CHECKED

  4. Why Completeness Score is 2.0/10

  The acceptance validator has a "completeness" dimension but it's measuring:
  - TODO/FIXME count (indicates incomplete work)
  - NOT: Whether acceptance criteria are satisfied

  This is why we see:
  - Completeness: 2.0/10 (found TODOs, code is skeletal)
  - But validator didn't fail the WO explicitly for missing criteria

  ---
  Training Opportunity

  These acceptance criteria are perfect for generating training data because:

  Option 1: Generate Tests from Criteria

  For each WO, you could:
  // Criterion: ".editorconfig exists"
  test('editorconfig file should exist', () => {
    expect(fs.existsSync('.editorconfig')).toBe(true)
  })

  // Criterion: "Indent rules are configured"
  test('editorconfig should have indent rules', () => {
    const content = fs.readFileSync('.editorconfig', 'utf-8')
    expect(content).toMatch(/indent_style/)
    expect(content).toMatch(/indent_size/)
  })

  Option 2: LLM-Based Verification

  Use Claude to check:
  Given this work order and acceptance criteria:
  [WO details + criteria]

  And this generated code:
  [code]

  Check each criterion and return:
  {
    "criterion_1": { "met": true/false, "reason": "..." },
    "criterion_2": { "met": true/false, "reason": "..." },
    ...
    "completeness_score": 8/10
  }

  Option 3: Enhanced Training Labels

  Create training dataset:
  {
    "work_order": {
      "title": "Add TypeScript strict mode",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "TypeScript strict mode is enabled",
        "No type errors in codebase",
        "Change is documented"
      ]
    },
    "bad_output": {
      "code": "{ strict: true }",
      "criteria_met": [true, false, false],  // Only met 1/3
      "score": 3.3
    },
    "good_output": {
      "code": "{ strict: true, strictNullChecks: true, ... }",
      "criteria_met": [true, true, true],   // Met all 3
      "score": 9.0
    }
  }

  Recommendation

  For your GPU training approach, I'd suggest:

  1. Export all 57 WOs with acceptance_criteria
  2. Generate "gold standard" implementations using Claude Sonnet 4.5 that actually satisfy all criteria
  3. Create verification tests for each criterion
  4. Train gpt-4o-mini to generate code that passes those tests
  5. Measure success by % of criteria satisfied, not just build success

  This would directly address the completeness problem (2.0/10) by forcing the model to actually satisfy requirements, not just generate buildable code.       

  Want me to create an export script that structures this data for training?
