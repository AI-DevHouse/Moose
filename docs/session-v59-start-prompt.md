# Session v59 Start Prompt

Read `docs/session-v59-handover.md` first, then:

1. Close test PR #4 and delete branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr close 4 --repo AI-DevHouse/Moose --delete-branch
   git branch -D feature/wo-8f8335d7-add-test-comment-to-readme
   rm README.md
   ```

2. Run 2 more E2E tests (Task 1.2 - need 3 total, have 1)

3. Begin Phase 2 (Learning Foundation) - see DELIVERY_PLAN_To_Production.md Phase 2A starting line 251

Current status: Phase 1 mostly complete, pipeline validated working end-to-end.
