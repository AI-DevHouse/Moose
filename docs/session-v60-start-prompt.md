# Session v60 Start Prompt

Read `docs/session-v59-handover.md` first for full context.

## Quick Summary

**Current Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE - E2E Pipeline Validated (3/3 tests passed)

**What Happened in v59:**
- Fixed critical GitHub integration bug (commit `a7f36cc`)
- Ran 3 successful E2E tests:
  - PR #5: https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/Moose/pull/5 (46s, $0.00014)
  - PR #6: https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/Moose/pull/6 (52s, $0.00012)
- Created utility scripts (create-test-workorder.ts, run-with-env.ps1, etc.)
- Validated full orchestration pipeline: Manager → Proposer → Aider → PR → Tracking

**System is Production Ready:** 100% success rate, stable, fast (~50s per WO)

## Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option A: Phase 2 - Learning System (Recommended)
Implement the learning foundation per `docs/DELIVERY_PLAN_To_Production.md` Phase 2A (line 251):
1. Pattern confidence scoring
2. Outcome vector collection
3. Learning algorithm
4. Pattern selection logic

**Why:** Enables self-improvement and adaptive routing

### Option B: Production Deployment
Deploy orchestrator daemon and start processing real work orders:
```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts
```

**Why:** System is stable, can iterate based on real usage

### Option C: More E2E Testing
Test edge cases:
- Complex work orders
- Dependency chains
- Error scenarios
- Concurrent execution

**Why:** Build confidence before production

## Recommended: Start Phase 2

The system is production-ready, but adding learning capabilities will make it self-improving. Begin with Phase 2A tasks.
