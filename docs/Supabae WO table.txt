## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata
- **decomposition_source**: generated
- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

# Implementation Plan

## Decomposition Metadata
- **decomposition_source**: generated
- **original_structure**: none_detected
- **complexity_assessment**: low

## Overview
This specification describes a document termination marker feature with no technical implementation requirements. The feature is purely structural and serves as a boundary marker for document parsing systems.

## Work Order Sequence
```
WO-0 (Document Marker) → WO-1 (Parser Logic) → WO-2 (Testing)
```

## Rationale
The specification contains minimal technical requirements, essentially documenting a document structure pattern rather than a functional system. The decomposition creates three lightweight work orders:

1. **WO-0**: Define the marker format and documentation
2. **WO-1**: Implement parser recognition logic
3. **WO-2**: Test and validate behavior

This is the minimal viable decomposition for what appears to be a documentation-focused feature.

## Risk Assessment
- **Overall Risk**: Low
- All work orders are documentation or simple parsing logic
- No external dependencies or complex integrations
- Clear acceptance criteria for each phase

## Notes
This specification appears to be a meta-document describing document structure rather than a functional feature requiring implementation. If this is intended to represent actual parsing infrastructure, additional requirements around file formats, specification schemas, and integration points would be beneficial.

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata

- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

- **Focus:** Performance optimization, error handling refinement, documentation, and packaging
- **Areas:** Performance tuning, Error handling polish, Documentation, Build and packaging


## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance.

- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations

- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata
- **decomposition_source**: generated
- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Section 1: END OF TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

# Implementation Plan

## Decomposition Metadata
- **decomposition_source**: generated
- **original_structure**: none_detected
- **complexity_assessment**: low

## Overview
This specification describes a document termination marker feature with no technical implementation requirements. The feature is purely structural and serves as a boundary marker for document parsing systems.

## Work Order Sequence
```
WO-0 (Document Marker) → WO-1 (Parser Logic) → WO-2 (Testing)
```

## Rationale
The specification contains minimal technical requirements, essentially documenting a document structure pattern rather than a functional system. The decomposition creates three lightweight work orders:

1. **WO-0**: Define the marker format and documentation
2. **WO-1**: Implement parser recognition logic
3. **WO-2**: Test and validate behavior

This is the minimal viable decomposition for what appears to be a documentation-focused feature.

## Risk Assessment
- **Overall Risk**: Low
- All work orders are documentation or simple parsing logic
- No external dependencies or complex integrations
- Clear acceptance criteria for each phase

## Notes
This specification appears to be a meta-document describing document structure rather than a functional feature requiring implementation. If this is intended to represent actual parsing infrastructure, additional requirements around file formats, specification schemas, and integration points would be beneficial.

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata

- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers

- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata

- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata
- **decomposition_source**: generated
- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure

## Decomposition Metadata
- **decomposition_source**: generated
- **extraction_confidence**: N/A
- **original_structure**: phase_based
- **batch_number**: 1/11
- **focus_area**: Project Infrastructure
- **modifications_made**: ["Organized Phase 1 requirements into logical sequential work orders", "Added explicit security baseline to testing WO", "Separated build tooling from architecture setup for clarity"]# IPC Communication Layer - Batch 2

## Overview
This batch implements the complete inter-process communication infrastructure for the Electron application, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Batch 1.

## Architecture Alignment
Based on Section 4.2 (IPC Communication) of the technical specification:
- Type-safe channel definitions with discriminated unions
- Security-first validation layer with origin checking and payload sanitization
- Promise-based renderer API with timeout and retry logic
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Work Order Strategy

### WO-4: Type Definitions Foundation
**Rationale:** Establishes type-safe contract between processes before implementation. Low risk as it''s pure TypeScript with no runtime logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete IPC channel enumeration
- Request/response payload interfaces
- Type exports for cross-process usage

### WO-5: Main Process Handlers (CRITICAL PATH)
**Rationale:** Core IPC handling logic with security validation. High risk due to security implications and complexity of handler registration system.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handler registration and dispatch system
- Security validation middleware (section 8.2 compliance)
- Integration with logging infrastructure from WO-3
- Whitelist-based origin validation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Main process architecture and BrowserWindow setup
- WO-3: Logger and security baseline
- WO-4: Type definitions for handler signatures

### WO-6: Renderer Process Client
**Rationale:** Safe exposure of IPC to renderer via contextBridge. Medium risk due to security surface area and complexity of promise correlation.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Promise-based invoke wrapper
- contextBridge API exposure
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Event subscription mechanism

**Dependencies:**
- WO-1: Preload script integration point
- WO-4: Type definitions for API surface
- WO-5: Main handlers must exist to respond

### WO-7: Error Handling & Monitoring
**Rationale:** Production-ready resilience and observability. Medium risk with focus on edge cases and failure scenarios.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Structured error hierarchy
- Cross-process error serialization
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Health check mechanism
- Circuit breaker for failure isolation

**Dependencies:**
- WO-5: Main handler error paths
- WO-6: Renderer error propagation

## Security Considerations
All work orders implement section 8.2 security requirements:
- No synchronous IPC (ipcRenderer.sendSync blocked)
- Origin validation on all main handlers
- Payload size limits (1MB default)
- No direct Node.js API exposure
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

## Testing Strategy
Follows specification testing requirements:
- Unit tests: 80% coverage target (Jest)
- Handler logic isolation testing
- Security validation test suite

## Overview
This project was decomposed using batched decomposition to handle 42 work orders.

## Estimation
This project requires 42 work orders because: (1) Multi-process Electron architecture requires careful IPC setup (8 WOs for infrastructure + IPC), (2) Complex state management with Redux and persistence (5 WOs), (3) Sophisticated clipboard automation with 4 different LLM provider integrations requiring browser automation (10 WOs), (4) Alignment service with Express server and OpenAI API (4 WOs), (5) Discussion orchestration with complex synchronization logic (4 WOs), (6) React UI with multiple views and real-time updates (9 WOs), (7) Comprehensive testing strategy covering 80% unit + integration + E2E (3 WOs). The specification explicitly outlines 7 phases with multiple components each, security requirements, and strict TypeScript compliance. Given the complexity of webview isolation, IPC security, clipboard automation timing, and multi-provider coordination, each batch is sized at 3-5 WOs to ensure focused, testable deliverables while respecting token limits.

## Batch Details
# Project Infrastructure - Batch 1

## Overview
This batch establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Multi-LLM Discussion App, focusing on proper Electron multi-process architecture, TypeScript strict mode configuration, build tooling, and testing infrastructure.

## Decomposition Strategy

### Sequential Dependency Chain
WO-0 → WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3

All work orders in this batch have sequential dependencies because:
1. **WO-0** creates the base project structure and TypeScript configuration required by all other components
2. **WO-1** depends on the directory structure and types from WO-0 to implement the multi-process architecture
3. **WO-2** requires the main/renderer processes from WO-1 to configure the build pipeline
4. **WO-3** needs the complete project structure and build system to set up testing infrastructure

### Alignment with Technical Specification

**Section 2: System Architecture** (Multi-process architecture)
- WO-1 implements the main process, renderer process, and preload script separation
- Establishes secure IPC communication foundation
- Configures context isolation and security boundaries

**Section 3.1: Technology Stack**
- WO-0 ensures Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit versions
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across all configurations

**Section 11: Security Requirements**
- WO-1 implements webview isolation, nodeIntegration disabled, context isolation
- WO-3 adds security validation utilities and IPC security testing

**Section 12: Testing Strategy**
- WO-3 establishes the 80/15/5 split (unit/integration/E2E)
- Configures separate test environments for main and renderer processes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (WO-0)
- Standard project initialization
- Well-documented setup patterns
- No complex logic

### Medium Risk (WO-1, WO-2, WO-3)
- **WO-1**: Electron security configuration requires precision; context isolation and IPC setup can be tricky
- **WO-2**: Build configuration complexity with separate pipelines for main/renderer/preload
- **WO-3**: Testing setup requires understanding of Electron''s multi-process testing challenges

## Token Budget Rationale

- **WO-0 (1,200 tokens)**: Configuration files are mostly declarative; low complexity
- **WO-1 (2,400 tokens)**: Multi-process architecture requires understanding security model and IPC patterns
- **WO-2 (2,800 tokens)**: Build system configuration is extensive with multiple environments
- **WO-3 (3,200 tokens)**: Testing infrastructure spans three test types and requires complex mocking utilities

**Total: 9,600 tokens (~$9.60)**

## Success Criteria for Batch Completion

✅ Application launches in development mode with HMR
✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors in strict mode
✅ IPC communication working between main and renderer processes
✅ Tests run successfully (npm test passes)
✅ Production build generates distributable package
✅ Security baseline implemented (context isolation, CSP headers)

## Next Batch Preview

Batch 2 will build on this infrastructure to implement:
- Redux store setup with redux-persist
- React component architecture and routing
- Configuration management system
- Logging infrastructure
