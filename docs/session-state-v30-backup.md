# Session State v30 (2025-10-01)

**Start here each session.** Reference other docs as needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Session Handover Protocol

**üö® ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY - MUST DO BEFORE CONTEXT RUNS OUT üö®**

**When to Update:** At **80-85% of context budget used** (160,000-170,000 tokens of 200,000), pause at the next logical task completion point.

**What Happens if Skipped:** Catastrophic loss of session progress - next session will not know what was accomplished, leading to duplicate work, confusion, and wasted time.

**Update Checklist (REQUIRED):**
1. ‚úÖ Update "Last Session Summary" section with completed work
2. ‚úÖ Update "Current Status" with new completions
3. ‚úÖ Update "Next Immediate Task" with what's pending
4. ‚úÖ Add new verification questions if new concepts introduced
5. ‚úÖ Update "Quick Reference" with new files/commands
6. ‚úÖ Sync architecture-decisions.md, known-issues.md if status changed
7. ‚úÖ Create git commit with session summary

**Example Session Summary Template:**
```markdown
## Last Session Summary (vN‚ÜívN+1)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ [Major accomplishment 1]
- ‚úÖ [Major accomplishment 2]
- ‚úÖ [Files created/modified with line counts]

**Key Learnings:**
- [Important discovery or pattern]
- [Error encountered and how fixed]

**Details:**
- **[Component]:** [Specific changes]
```

**DO NOT PROCEED with new major work if context is at 80%+ without updating handover docs first.**

---

## Last Session Summary (v29‚Üív30)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Session Handover Protocol:** Added critical session handover protocol to prevent context loss (triggers at 80-85% context usage)
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Sync:** Comprehensive review and update of all 7 docs folder files
- ‚úÖ **Fixed 7 major discrepancies:** Database migration status, model names, self-refinement status, Architect completion %, file rename clarity, Orchestrator prerequisites, TypeScript error count
- ‚úÖ **Updated 4 key documents:** session-state.md, architecture-decisions.md, Moose Agent Organizational Hierarchy.txt, Moose Agent Organizational Workflow.txt
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Error Analysis:** Identified and documented all 21 pre-existing errors (was incorrectly documented as 19)
- ‚úÖ **Integration Tests:** Verified 18/18 passing with 180s timeout

**Key Learnings:**
- Documentation drift is catastrophic - must sync at end of each session
- Session handover protocol prevents loss of work when context window fills
- Architect, Director, Manager, Proposers are ALL 100% complete (was incorrectly shown as 30% for Architect)
- Model name is "Claude Sonnet 4.5" not "Claude Sonnet 4" (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- Pre-existing TS errors: 21 total across 5 files (complexity-analyzer: 4, contract-validator: 1, director-service: 2, enhanced-proposer-service: 10, proposer-registry: 4)

**Documentation Changes:**
- **architecture-decisions.md:** Updated Architect/Director/Proposers/Orchestrator status, added file structure with line counts, marked components complete
- **session-state.md:** Added Session Handover Protocol section, Session End Checklist, updated error counts, added Orchestrator technical spec reference
- **known-issues.md:** Updated Issue #4 with accurate 21 error count and detailed breakdown by file with root causes
- **Hierarchy.txt & Workflow.txt:** Changed "Claude Sonnet 4" ‚Üí "Claude Sonnet 4.5"
- **rules-and-procedures.md:** Updated expected error count from 19 to 21

**Files Modified (tracked):**
- docs/session-state.md (v28 backup created)
- docs/architecture-decisions.md
- docs/known-issues.md
- docs/rules-and-procedures.md
- docs/Moose Agent Organizational Hierarchy.txt
- docs/Moose Agent Organizational Workflow.txt

## Current Status

**Phase 2.1/2.2/2.2.6/4.1 Complete + Database Migration:**
- ‚úÖ Architect API (`/api/architect/decompose`)
- ‚úÖ Database migration (5 columns added to work_orders) - **NEW**
- ‚úÖ Upload Spec UI tab (markdown textarea + decomposition display)
- ‚úÖ Director approval flow (`/api/director/approve`)
- ‚úÖ Manager routing API (`/api/manager` - POST + GET retry)
- ‚úÖ Self-refinement: 3-cycle adaptive prompting (was 1 cycle)
- ‚úÖ Centralized logic: architect-decomposition-rules.ts, director-risk-assessment.ts, proposer-refinement-rules.ts, manager-routing-rules.ts

**Infrastructure:**
- Server: localhost:3000
- Supabase: qclxdnbvoruvqnhsshjr
- Branch: test/contract-validation-integration
- Models: All using claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- Git: Modified (9 tracked files changed, 4 new migration scripts in scripts/)

**Testing:**
- Integration: 18/18 passing (100% - all tests pass with 180s timeout on refinement tests)
- TypeScript: No new errors from migration changes (21 pre-existing errors in complexity-analyzer, contract-validator, director-service, enhanced-proposer-service, proposer-registry)
- Database: Schema verified successfully, all 5 Architect columns present
- Pre-existing TS errors: 21 (unrelated to new code, no runtime impact)

---

## Next Immediate Task

### Phase 2.4: TypeScript Error Resolution - 1-2 hours

**Current State:** 21 pre-existing TypeScript errors across 5 files, no runtime impact but should be resolved before Orchestrator

**Goal:** Fix all 21 TypeScript errors to achieve clean compilation

**Error Breakdown:**
1. **complexity-analyzer.ts (4 errors)** - Lines 428, 434, 443, 445 - Type 'never' issues in routing validation
2. **contract-validator.ts (1 error)** - Line 153 - Supabase Json vs Contract[] type mismatch
3. **director-service.ts (2 errors)** - Lines 91, 147 - Overload mismatches on Work Order/decision inserts
4. **enhanced-proposer-service.ts (10 errors)** - Lines 356, 395-402 - MapIterator + implicit 'any' in reduce calls
5. **proposer-registry.ts (4 errors)** - Lines 56, 59, 62, 63 - Json type vs strict interface mismatches

**Approach:**
- Option A: Add proper type guards and narrow Json types to specific interfaces
- Option B: Add `@ts-expect-error` with comments where Supabase Json type is unavoidable
- Option C: Relax tsconfig (not recommended - loses type safety)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ `npx tsc --noEmit` shows 0 errors
- ‚úÖ All 18/18 integration tests still passing
- ‚úÖ Next.js dev server compiles without warnings

**Alternative Priority:** Skip to Orchestrator and defer error fixes (user preference needed)

---

### Phase 2.3/3.2: Orchestrator (Aider-based execution infrastructure) - 5-7 hours (AFTER error fixes)

**Current State:** Database ready, Proposers generate code but no automated execution

**Goal:** Build Aider-based infrastructure to apply code to repository

**Prerequisites:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Database migration finished, work_orders table has all required columns

**Technical Specification:** See `docs/Technical Specification - Orchestrator.txt` for complete implementation plan

**Architecture:**
- NOT an agent - this is tooling/infrastructure
- Uses Aider CLI for git-aware code application
- Node.js child_process (containerization deferred)
- GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD

**4-Phase Implementation Plan:**
1. **Phase 1 (2-3h):** Core Infrastructure - Poller, Manager Coordinator, Proposer Executor, Orchestrator Service, API endpoints
2. **Phase 2 (2-3h):** Aider Integration - Executor, instruction files, branch management, error handling
3. **Phase 3 (1-2h):** GitHub Integration - PR creation with metadata, Result Tracker
4. **Phase 4 (1h):** Testing & Polish - Integration tests, E2E flow, documentation updates

**File Structure:**
- `src/lib/orchestrator/` - 7 core files (orchestrator-service.ts, work-order-poller.ts, manager-coordinator.ts, proposer-executor.ts, aider-executor.ts, github-integration.ts, result-tracker.ts)
- `src/app/api/orchestrator/` - 2 API endpoints (status/start/stop, manual execution)

**Alternative Priority:** Phase 2.5 Client Manager (escalation UI) - discuss with user first

---

## Context Verification (Required Before Work)

Answer these to confirm doc comprehension:

**Q1:** What is the architectural pattern for agent logic organization, and which THREE agents currently follow this pattern?

**Q2:** What are the THREE refinement cycle strategies in Phase 2.2.6, and what triggers the zero-progress abort?

**Q3:** What are the TWO validation thresholds for Phase 2.1 Architect (WO count range and max token budget per WO)?

**Q4:** What is the current cost per decomposition, and what percentage of the monthly LLM budget does this represent at 1-2 decompositions/day?

**Q5:** What are the Director approval thresholds (cost, confidence, risk) for auto-approval, and where are they defined?

**Q6:** What was the refinement success rate in Phase 2.2.6 testing (initial errors ‚Üí final errors ‚Üí improvement %), and how many cycles were used?

**Q7:** What is the dependency validation behavior in v25, why was strict validation relaxed, and what constraint does this temporarily violate?

**Q8:** What is the next phase priority (Phase 2.3 Orchestrator vs Phase 2.5 Client Manager), and what is the key architectural principle about Orchestrator?

**Q9:** What five columns were added to the work_orders table for Architect integration, and were they successfully migrated?

**Q10:** What is the root cause of the Security Hard Stop test failure on cold start, what is the workaround, and what is the planned fix?

**Q11 (NEW):** What was the root cause of the system_config SQL error during migration, and how was it fixed?

**Q12 (NEW):** Why did type generation fail using Supabase CLI, and what was the workaround?
