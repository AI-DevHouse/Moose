## What is Moose?

**Moose Mission Control** is an LLM-orchestrated autonomous code generation system.

### How It Works (High-Level):

```
User submits Technical Spec
    ↓
Architect Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5) decomposes into Work Orders
    ↓
Orchestrator polls pending Work Orders
    ↓
Manager routes each WO to appropriate LLM (based on complexity/budget)
    ↓
Proposer (Claude/GPT) generates code solution
    ↓
Aider applies code changes to local git repo
    ↓
GitHub Integration creates Pull Request
    ↓
Result tracked in database (costs, performance, failures)
```

### Key Components:

- **Architect Agent:** Decomposes technical specs into work orders
- **Orchestrator:** Polls and executes work orders (daemon process)
- **Manager:** Routes work orders to appropriate LLM based on complexity
- **Proposer:** Generates code using Claude Sonnet 4.5 or GPT-4o-mini
- **Aider Executor:** Applies code changes using Aider CLI
- **GitHub Integration:** Creates PRs via gh CLI
- **Result Tracker:** Records costs, execution time, success/failure

### Database (Supabase):

- `projects` - Project metadata (local_path, github_org, github_repo_name)
- `work_orders` - Tasks to execute (status, dependencies, acceptance_criteria)
- `outcome_vectors` - Execution results (cost, time, success/failure, failure_class)
- `escalations` - Failures escalated for human intervention
- `decision_logs` - All routing/refinement/escalation decisions
- `cost_tracking` - Daily spend tracking

### Current Phase:

- **Phase 0 & 1 COMPLETE:** Failure classification and decision logging implemented
- **Phase 2 NOT STARTED:** Supervised learning system (not needed for this test)
- **Priority NOW:** First real production test with actual app

---

## What We're Doing

### Goal: First Production Test

Build a **real application** from start to finish using Moose to validate the entire pipeline works in production.

### Test Application:

- **Name:** Multi-LLM Discussion App v1
- **Type:** Electron desktop application
- **Tech Spec:** 77,081 characters, 2,583 lines (detailed implementation spec)
- **Location:** `C:\dev\specs\Multi-LLM Discussion App_Technical Specification_ v2.2.txt`
- **Expected:** 40+ work orders
- **Budget:** $150
- **Technologies:** Electron v28+, TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Redux Toolkit, Supabase

### Test Environment:

- **Project Path:** `C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1`
- **GitHub Repo:** `AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1` (already created)
- **Supabase Project:** `multi-llm-discussion-v1` (already created)
  - URL: `https://czwzmvrsfcuexudqiscr.supabase.co`
  - Keys: Stored in setup scripts
- **Moose Database Project ID:** `f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951`

### What We're Testing:

1. **Architect decomposition** - Can it handle a large, detailed technical spec?
2. **Work order generation** - Are WOs logical and properly sequenced?
3. **Code generation quality** - Does generated code work?
4. **PR quality** - Are PRs well-structured and reviewable?
5. **Failure handling** - How does Phase 1 (failure classification) perform?
6. **Cost tracking** - Is spending within budget?
7. **End-to-end flow** - Does the complete pipeline work without manual intervention?

### Success Criteria:

- ✅ Architect successfully decomposes spec into WOs
- ✅ At least 60% of WOs complete successfully
- ✅ Generated code compiles (TypeScript passes)
- ✅ PRs are created on GitHub
- ✅ Total cost stays under $150
- ✅ No manual intervention required (except starting/stopping)

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### Issues Discovered:

1. **Setup script had wrong column name** (`metadata` → `setup_notes`)
2. **Setup script not idempotent** (left artifacts on failure)
3. **Architect expects structured JSON, not raw text** (77K spec timed out)
4. **CRITICAL: Architect can't handle large specs** (>10K chars timeout)

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. Fixed Setup Scripts
- Corrected `metadata` → `setup_notes` in projects table
- Created `scripts/complete-setup.ts` for manual recovery
- Documented issues in `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md`

#### 2. **MAJOR FEATURE: Spec Preprocessor** ✅

**Problem:** Architect timed out trying to process 77K-character technical spec in one API call.

**Solution:** Built intelligent preprocessor that:
- Parses large documents by section headers (markdown ##, numbered 4.1, Phase X)
- Converts each section to structured `TechnicalSpec` using Claude
- Submits each section to Architect separately
- Combines work orders from all sections
- Adds cross-section dependencies

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/spec-preprocessor.ts` (380 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts` (integrated preprocessor)
- `scripts/submit-tech-spec.ts` (simplified to pass raw spec)

**How It Works:**
```
Raw 77K Spec
    ↓
SpecPreprocessor.preprocess()
    ├─ Parse document structure (find section headers)
    ├─ For each section:
    │   ├─ Call Claude to extract TechnicalSpec (objectives, constraints, criteria)
    │   ├─ Submit to batched-architect-service
    │   └─ Collect work orders
    ├─ Add cross-section dependencies (sequential)
    └─ Return combined work orders
    ↓
Database (ready for orchestrator)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles real-world detailed specs (50K-100K+ chars)
- ✅ Preserves document structure
- ✅ Automatic (>10K chars triggers preprocessing)
- ✅ Transparent to orchestrator
- ✅ Part of Architect Agent responsibility (not separate component)

**Threshold:** Documents >10K characters automatically trigger preprocessing.

---

## Critical Issue Discovered and Resolved

### Issue: Architect Timeout on Large Specs

**What Happened:**
- Tried to submit 77K-character spec to Architect
- API call timed out after 3+ minutes
- Blocked entire test from proceeding

**Root Cause:**
- Architect expects small structured `TechnicalSpec` (5-15 objectives/constraints/criteria)
- We had detailed 2,583-line implementation document
- Embedding entire doc in API call → massive token usage → timeout

**Resolution:**
- Built spec preprocessor (see above)
- Now part of Architect Agent responsibility
- Enables production use with detailed specs

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (tested and integrated)

---

## Current State

### Project Setup: ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Local directory created: `C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1`
- ✅ Git initialized on `main` branch
- ✅ GitHub repo created: `AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1`
- ✅ Git remote configured
- ✅ Project created in Moose database (ID: `f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951`)
- ✅ Supabase project created for app: `multi-llm-discussion-v1`

### Moose Enhancements: ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Spec preprocessor implemented
- ✅ Integrated into Architect API
- ✅ Tested and ready

### Ready to Execute: ✅ YES

**Everything is in place to:**
1. Submit technical spec to Architect
2. Start orchestrator daemon
3. Monitor execution
4. Analyze results

### Not Done Yet: ❌

- ❌ Technical spec NOT submitted to Architect yet
- ❌ Work orders NOT created yet
- ❌ Orchestrator NOT started yet
- ❌ No code generated yet

**Why?** We discovered the large spec issue and built the preprocessor. Now we're ready to actually run the test.

---

## Next Steps for New Session

### Step 1: Submit Technical Spec to Architect

**What:** Send the 77K-character technical spec to Architect for decomposition.

**How:**
```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/submit-tech-spec.ts
```

**Expected:**
- Runtime: 2-5 minutes (preprocessing + decomposition)
- Output: Work orders created (likely 30-50)
- Logs: Will show preprocessing in action

**What to Look For:**
- "🔄 Large document detected - using spec preprocessor..."
- "📦 Processing X sections through Architect..."
- "✅ Generated Y work orders"
- "📊 Total: Z work orders from X sections"

**Success:**
- API returns `{ success: true, work_orders_created: N, preprocessing_used: true }`
- Work orders visible in database with status='pending'

**If It Fails:**
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify Next.js dev server is running: `npm run dev`
- Check `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md` for troubleshooting

---

### Step 2: Verify Work Orders Created

**What:** Check that work orders are in the database and ready for execution.

**How:**
```bash
# Query database to see work orders
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/list-work-orders.ts
```

**Or use SQL:**
```sql
SELECT id, title, status, dependencies
FROM work_orders
WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

**What to Look For:**
- All WOs have `status = 'pending'`
- Dependencies are set correctly (early WOs have few/no deps, later WOs depend on earlier ones)
- Titles make sense and align with the tech spec

---

### Step 3: Start Orchestrator Daemon

**What:** Start the polling daemon that executes work orders.

**How:**
```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Polls every 10 seconds
- Max 3 concurrent work orders
- Prints status every 30 seconds
- Runs until you stop it (Ctrl+C)

**Console Output:**
```
🚀 Orchestrator Daemon Started
==========================================
Polling interval: 10000ms
Max concurrent executions: 3
------------------------------------------

[10:23:45] 📊 Status: 0 executing, 45 pending

```

**How Long:**
- With 40 WOs at ~1-2 min each → ~60-120 minutes total
- Watch for failures and escalations
- Let it run to completion

**To Stop:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` (graceful shutdown)
- Or close terminal window (may leave WOs in `in_progress` state)

---

### Step 4: Monitor Execution

**During Execution:**

1. **Watch the console** - Real-time progress
2. **Check GitHub PRs** - PRs should appear as WOs complete
3. **Monitor costs** - Check `cost_tracking` table

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Success rate:** Completed / Total
- **Failure rate:** Failed / Total
- **Average cost per WO**
- **Average time per WO**
- **Failure classifications** (from Phase 1 data)

**SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- Overall progress
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(actual_cost), 2) as avg_cost
FROM work_orders
WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
GROUP BY status;

-- Failure breakdown (Phase 1 data)
SELECT
  failure_class,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM outcome_vectors
WHERE work_order_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM work_orders
  WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
)
GROUP BY failure_class;

-- Daily spend
SELECT SUM(cost) as total_spent
FROM cost_tracking
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

---

### Step 5: Analyze Results

**After Execution Completes:**

1. **Review GitHub PRs** - Check code quality
2. **Check if app builds** - `cd C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1 && npm install && npm run build`
3. **Analyze failures** - Use Phase 1 failure_class data
4. **Calculate metrics** - Success rate, cost, time
5. **Update tracking doc** - `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md`

**Key Questions:**
- Did it reach 60% success rate?
- What were the main failure types?
- Is generated code good quality?
- Did it stay under budget ($150)?
- What improvements does Moose need?

---

### Step 6: Document Findings

**Update:** `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md`

**Include:**
- Final metrics (success rate, cost, time)
- Failure breakdown by type
- Issues discovered during execution
- Improvements needed in Moose
- Assessment: Ready for production? Or more work needed?

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Tech spec not found"

**Cause:** File path incorrect

**Fix:** Verify path in script matches actual location:
```bash
ls "C:\dev\specs\Multi-LLM Discussion App_Technical Specification_ v2.2.txt"
```

---

### Issue: "Architect API failed: 400"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Next.js dev server not running
2. Invalid spec format
3. Security check failed

**Fix:**
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Check logs for detailed error
3. Review `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts:249-260` for error handling

---

### Issue: "Preprocessing timeout"

**Cause:** Too many sections or LLM calls taking too long

**Fix:**
1. Increase timeout in `scripts/submit-tech-spec.ts`
2. Check section count in logs
3. Consider breaking spec into smaller documents

---

### Issue: "Work orders not executing"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Dependencies not satisfied
2. Approval not set
3. Orchestrator not polling

**Fix:**
1. Check `work_orders.dependencies` - earlier WOs must complete first
2. Verify `metadata.auto_approved = true`
3. Restart orchestrator daemon

---

### Issue: "High failure rate (>40%)"

**Analyze:**
```sql
SELECT failure_class, COUNT(*)
FROM outcome_vectors
WHERE work_order_id IN (SELECT id FROM work_orders WHERE project_id = '...')
GROUP BY failure_class;
```

**Common Fixes:**
- `compile_error` → Check TypeScript configs in generated code
- `contract_violation` → Review breaking changes detection
- `orchestration_error` → Check Aider/git/PR creation logs
- `timeout` → Increase timeout in proposer or Aider

---

### Issue: "Budget exceeded"

**Check Daily Spend:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(cost) FROM cost_tracking WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Budget Limits:**
- $20 - Soft cap (warning)
- $50 - Hard cap (force cheapest model)
- $100 - Emergency kill (stop all operations)

**Fix:** If hitting caps prematurely, review routing decisions in Manager logs.

---

### Issue: "Aider fails with 'git not found'"

**Cause:** Windows PATH issue

**Fix:** Ensure all git commands use `shell: true` option (already implemented in v58+)

---

### Issue: "PR creation fails"

**Common Causes:**
1. gh CLI not authenticated
2. Wrong repo format
3. Branch already pushed

**Fix:**
1. Run `gh auth status`
2. Verify repo format: `AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1` (not just `multi-llm-discussion-v1`)
3. Check if branch exists: `git branch -a`

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Check Status
```bash

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/list-work-orders.ts

# Check project
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-project.ts

# View latest escalation
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-latest-escalation.ts
```

### Restart Clean
```bash
# If you need to start over (WARNING: deletes work orders)
# 1. Delete work orders from database (SQL)
DELETE FROM work_orders WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951';

# 2. Re-submit tech spec
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/submit-tech-spec.ts
```

### Emergency Stop
```bash
# Stop orchestrator: Ctrl+C
# Check for stuck work orders:
UPDATE work_orders
SET status = 'failed'
WHERE status = 'in_progress'
AND project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951';
```

---

## Success Indicators

### Good Signs ✅

- Work orders completing at steady pace (~1-2 min each)
- PRs appearing on GitHub with good descriptions
- Costs staying under $0.50 per WO on average
- Success rate >60%
- TypeScript builds passing
- Logs show normal execution flow

### Warning Signs ⚠️

- Many `orchestration_error` failures (Aider/git issues)
- Costs >$1 per WO consistently (routing to expensive model unnecessarily)
- High `contract_violation` rate (breaking change detection too sensitive)
- Work orders stuck in `in_progress` (capacity issue or crash)

### Critical Issues ❌

- Daily spend approaching $50+ (hitting hard cap)
- Success rate <40% (fundamental issues with Moose)
- Orchestrator crashing repeatedly (check logs for errors)
- No work orders executing at all (dependencies not set correctly)

---

## Context for New Session

**You are continuing from Session v62 where we:**
1. Discovered Architect couldn't handle large specs
2. Built spec preprocessor to solve it
3. Got everything ready for first production test

**Your immediate task:**
1. Read this handover document
2. Run Step 1: Submit tech spec to Architect
3. Verify work orders created
4. Start orchestrator and monitor
5. Analyze results and document findings

**You have NO other context except:**
- This handover document
- The files in `C:\dev\moose-mission-control`
- The tracking document `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md`

**Key Understanding:**
- Moose is a working system (Phases 0 & 1 complete)
- This is the FIRST real production test
- We're validating the entire pipeline works
- Spec preprocessor is NEW (built this session)
- Everything is ready - just execute the test
