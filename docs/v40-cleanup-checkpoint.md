# v40 Branch Cleanup - Checkpoint
**Date:** 2025-10-03 | **Tokens:** 60,163/200,000 (30%)

## Current Situation
**Branch:** `feature/orchestrator-complete-clean` (clean, pushed to GitHub)
**Backup:** `backup-v40-pre-cleanup` (all work preserved, can be deleted after PR merge)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All phases successful

## What Was Done
Created clean branch WITHOUT secrets (commit `9fd1400` had `.env.local` + API keys) to enable GitHub push.

## Progress
✅ Phase 1: Main synced with origin
✅ Phase 2: Closed stale PR #1
✅ Phase 3: Clean branch COMPLETE - Used git filter-branch to remove secrets
✅ Phase 4: GitHub push SUCCESS

## Solution Used
Instead of cherry-picking (which was error-prone), used `git filter-branch` to remove secrets from entire branch history:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/orchestrator-complete-clean backup-v40-pre-cleanup
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local 'Moose-Mission-Control API Keys.txt' .aider.chat.history.md tsconfig.tsbuildinfo" \
  --prune-empty -- main..HEAD
git push -u origin feature/orchestrator-complete-clean --force
```

Result: ✅ All 45 commits pushed to GitHub successfully

## Next Steps (In Order)
1. ✅ **GitHub Push:** COMPLETE - Branch pushed successfully
2. ✅ **Create Pull Request:** COMPLETE - PR #2 created
   - URL: https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/Moose/pull/2
   - Title: "feat: Complete Orchestrator E2E Testing & Error Handling (Phase 2-3)"
   - Description: Comprehensive summary of 27,675 lines across 132 files
   - **IMPORTANT:** Use "Squash and merge" option when merging (47 commits → 1-3 logical commits)
3. ✅ **Pre-commit Hook:** COMPLETE - Installed and tested
   - Blocks: `.env.local`, `*API Keys*.txt`, and secret patterns (API keys, tokens)
   - Location: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
   - Tested: ✅ Successfully blocks secrets
4. **Review PR:** Verify all essential work is included (27,675 lines: all src/, tests, APIs, docs)
5. **Merge to main:** After review/approval (USE SQUASH MERGE)
6. **Delete branches:** After merge completes
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git branch -d feature/orchestrator-complete-clean
   git branch -d backup-v40-pre-cleanup
   git branch -d backup-pre-gc
   git branch -d backup-pre-claude-code
   git branch -d feature/wo-c16ccf0c-e2e-test-simple-typescript-fun
   git push origin --delete test/contract-validation-integration
   ```

## Essential Commits in Clean Branch
Already cherry-picked (29 commits):
- Phase 2.1/2.2: Architect, Director, Manager, Proposer (complete)
- Phase 2.3: Orchestrator (8 files, 1152 lines)
- Phase 3: Error handling (error-escalation.ts, budget race fix, 10 tests)
- Phase 3.1: Sentinel MVP
- Phase 2.5: Client Manager

Need to add (3 commits):
- `6a57673`: **Critical E2E Fixes** - Bug #3 (GET endpoint), Bug #4 (approval field), Bug #5 (createWorkOrder fields)
- `51f01e7`: Repository cleanup (gitignore improvements)
- `8ac0120`: Branch cleanup documentation

## Key Files Modified in v40 (Need These)
- `src/app/api/work-orders/[id]/route.ts` - Added GET handler
- `src/lib/api-client.ts` - Added getById() + extended createWorkOrder()
- `src/lib/orchestrator/work-order-poller.ts` - Dual field name support
- `.gitignore` - Added IDE settings, backups, secrets patterns
- `docs/github-branch-cleanup-plan.md` - NEW (this cleanup strategy)

## Backup Recovery (If Needed)
```bash
git checkout backup-v40-pre-cleanup  # Restore everything
```

## Test Command
```bash
node test-orchestrator-e2e-simple.js  # Should push to GitHub successfully on clean branch
```

## Why This Matters
Current branch has secrets in history → GitHub blocks push → E2E test can't create PR
Clean branch has NO secrets → GitHub allows push → E2E test validates full pipeline

## Git Best Practices (Lessons Learned)

### Branch Management Rules
1. **One feature = one branch** - Don't mix unrelated changes
2. **Branch from main, merge to main** - Always create from latest main
3. **Keep branches short-lived** - Days, not weeks (avoid drift)
4. **Delete after merge** - No stale branches
5. **Squash large PRs** - 47 commits → 1-3 logical commits for main history

### Naming Conventions
- ✅ `feature/descriptive-name` - Feature work
- ✅ `bugfix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- ✅ `hotfix/critical-issue` - Production fixes
- ✅ `backup-{description}` - Temporary backups (delete after confirmation)

### Security & Hygiene
- ❌ **NEVER commit secrets** - Use `.gitignore` from day 1
- ✅ **Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`** - Before first commit
- ✅ **Review diffs before commit** - Check for API keys, passwords, tokens
- ✅ **Use pre-commit hooks** - Automated secret scanning

### Main Branch Protection (Recommended)
- ✅ Require PR reviews (1+ approvers)
- ✅ Require passing CI/tests
- ✅ Prohibit direct pushes to main
- ✅ Prohibit force pushes to main

### Cleanup Schedule
**After PR merge:**
- Delete feature branch (local + remote)
- Delete backup branches (after confirming main stable)

**Weekly:**
- Check for stale branches: `git branch -a`
- Delete merged/abandoned branches

### Current Violations Found
1. ❌ 47 commits in feature branch (should squash to 1-3)
2. ❌ 3 backup branches (should delete after PR merge)
3. ❌ 2 stale branches (old work orders + closed PR)
4. ❌ Secrets committed (required `git filter-branch` to fix)

### Grade: C+ → A- (After Cleanup)
**Before:** Functional but cluttered (4 violations)
**After cleanup:** Clean, organized, secure (0 violations)
