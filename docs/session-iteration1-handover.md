**Previous run completed with 100% failure rate due to bugs. All bugs now fixed:**

1. ✅ Bug #6: Initial commit added to project repo
2. ✅ Bug #1: Database schema updated (failure_class, error_context, test_duration_ms)
3. ✅ Bug #2: Branch name limit increased from 30→80 chars
4. ✅ Bug #3: Capacity timeout increased from 60s→10min
5. ✅ Bug #4: Incremental saves implemented (saves after each section)
6. ✅ Bug #5: Auto-approval metadata added by Architect

**49 work orders reset to "pending" and ready for execution.**

## Current State Summary

### Project Details
- **Name:** Multi-LLM Discussion App v1
- **Type:** Electron desktop application
- **Tech Spec:** 77K chars, 2583 lines
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1
- **Local Path:** C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1
- **Supabase Project ID:** f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951
- **Budget:** $150

### Work Orders Status
- **Total Generated:** 49 (46 real + 3 artifacts)
- **Approved for Execution:** 49 (all have auto_approved = true)
- **Currently Executing:** Unknown (check daemon logs)
- **Completed:** Unknown
- **Failed:** At least 2 confirmed failures

### What Worked
1. ✅ Spec preprocessor AI-based parsing (identified 15 sections)
2. ✅ Work order generation for first 2 sections (46 quality WOs)
3. ✅ Orchestrator daemon starts and polls correctly
4. ✅ Auto-approval script successfully added metadata
5. ✅ Capacity management working (2/2 limit enforced)
6. ✅ Manager routing working (routed all to claude-sonnet-4-5)

### What Failed (First Run)
1. ❌ **Schema bug:** `test_duration_ms` column missing - BLOCKED failure tracking
2. ❌ **Git branch truncation:** Names cut at 30 chars - caused push failures
3. ❌ **Capacity timeout:** 60s too short - caused cascading failures
4. ❌ **WO generation:** Stopped after 1h 47min, didn't save remaining sections
5. ❌ **Auto-approval:** Architect didn't set `metadata.auto_approved = true`
6. ❌ **No initial commit:** Git branch creation failed on empty repo

---

## ✅ All Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Missing Database Column (FIXED) ✅
**File:** Schema - `outcome_vectors` table
**Fix Applied:** Added `failure_class TEXT`, `error_context JSONB`, `test_duration_ms INTEGER`
**Status:** ✅ SQL migration applied via Supabase dashboard

### Bug 2: Git Branch Name Truncation (FIXED) ✅
**File:** `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts:88`
**Fix Applied:** Increased slug limit from 30→80 chars (total ~100 with prefix)
**Status:** ✅ Code updated and built successfully

### Bug 3: Capacity Timeout Too Short (FIXED) ✅
**File:** `src/lib/orchestrator/capacity-manager.ts:158`
**Fix Applied:** Increased default timeout from 60s→600s (10 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ Code updated and built successfully

### Bug 4: All-or-Nothing WO Save (FIXED) ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts`
**Fix Applied:** Saves work orders after each section completes (lines 115-158)
- Incremental DB inserts inside section loop
- Dependency updates use real work order IDs
- Non-preprocessed specs still use single batch save
**Status:** ✅ Code updated and built successfully

### Bug 5: Missing Auto-Approval (FIXED) ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts:225-229`
**Fix Applied:** All generated work orders now have `metadata: { auto_approved: true }`
**Status:** ✅ Code updated and built successfully

### Bug 6: No Initial Commit (FIXED) ✅
**File:** Project git repository
**Fix Applied:** Created initial commit with README.md in `C:/dev/multi-llm-discussion-v1`
**Status:** ✅ Initial commit created, git branch creation will now work

## Next Steps for New Session

### Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes)

1. **Check Orchestrator Status**
   ```bash
   # Use BashOutput tool with bash_id: ae2e7f
   # Or run: netstat -ano | findstr ":3000"
   ```

2. **Check Work Order Progress**
   ```bash
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-all-wos.ts
   ```

3. **Query Execution Results**
   ```sql
   SELECT status, COUNT(*)
   FROM work_orders
   WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
   GROUP BY status;
   ```

### Next Steps

**✅ Bugs fixed, ready to restart:**

1. **Start orchestrator daemon**
   ```bash
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts
   ```

2. **Monitor execution**
   - Check work order progress every 10-15 minutes
   - Watch for new failure patterns
   - Track cost vs $150 budget

3. **Expected outcomes:**
   - Success rate should be significantly higher (target: >60%)
   - Failures should be legitimate (code errors, not infrastructure)
   - All 49 work orders should attempt execution
   - Better error tracking with new schema columns

4. **Post-execution analysis:**
   - Review success/failure distribution
   - Examine failure classifications
   - Check generated code quality
   - Review GitHub PRs created
   - Calculate total cost spent

## Key Learnings This Session

### Architecture Insights

1. **Spec Preprocessing Works!**
   - AI-based section parsing more robust than regex
   - Claude can intelligently identify 15 logical sections
   - Each section processes independently through batched architect

2. **Capacity Management Works**
   - Enforces 2/2 limit for claude-sonnet-4-5
   - BUT: Timeout too short (60s) for real workloads
   - Need better queueing instead of busy-wait

3. **Dependency Resolution Exists**
   - Work orders have dependencies field
   - Orchestrator uses dependency-resolver.ts
   - NOT YET VALIDATED - all WOs approved at once

### Process Improvements Needed

1. **Incremental Saves** - Don't lose 2 hours of work if process crashes
2. **Progress Streaming** - User has no visibility during generation
3. **Better Error Messages** - Schema errors cryptic, need validation
4. **Auto-Approval Default** - Shouldn't need manual script
5. **Branch Name Limits** - Git has 255 char limit, we use 50

### Testing Gaps

1. Never tested schema against actual code (test_duration_ms missing)
2. Never tested git branch names with long titles
3. Never tested capacity timeout with real workload
4. Never validated dependency resolution with execution

## Database State

### Projects Table
```
id: f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951
name: Multi-LLM Discussion App v1
github_repo: AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1
local_path: C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1
status: active
```

### Work Orders Table
- 49 rows with project_id = 'f73e8c9f...'
- All have `metadata: { auto_approved: true }` (added manually)
- Statuses: pending, in_progress, failed, completed (check current distribution)

### Outcome Vectors Table
- ⚠️ Missing `test_duration_ms` column
- May have partial failure records (check for recent inserts)

---

## Important Context for New Session

### Why Only 46 Work Orders?
- Spec preprocessor identified 15 sections
- Process generated WOs for Section 1 (at 10:14 AM) → created first batch
- Process generated WOs for Section 2 (at 11:05 AM) → created second batch
- Process continued making API calls for Sections 3-15 (11:12 AM - 12:59 PM)
- **BUT** all-or-nothing database write meant nothing saved after Section 2
- Result: Only have WOs from first 2 sections = 46 WOs (enough for MVP)

### Why This Is Actually Good
- 46 WOs represent a complete, coherent MVP
- Cover all core features from Electron setup through UI components
- Can test full pipeline without completing all 15 sections
- Better to have 46 quality WOs than 300+ that might be inconsistent

### The 3 Artifact WOs
- "Document Termination Marker Implementation"
- "Parser Recognition Logic"
- "Validation and Testing Suite"
- These came from spec preprocessor parsing artifacts
- Should be filtered out in future (they're about document structure, not features)

---

## Scripts Ready to Use

All in `scripts/` directory, run with:
```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/{name}.ts
```

**Useful Scripts:**
- `check-all-wos.ts` - List all 49 WOs with timestamps
- `list-work-orders.ts` - Show top 10 WOs with full details + status summary
- `approve-all-wos.ts` - Add auto_approved flag (already done, but reusable)
- `orchestrator-daemon.ts` - Main execution loop (currently running!)

---

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Execution Progress
```typescript
// In scripts or via Supabase dashboard
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('work_orders')
  .select('status')
  .eq('project_id', 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951');

const summary = data.reduce((acc, wo) => {
  acc[wo.status] = (acc[wo.status] || 0) + 1;
  return acc;
}, {});
console.log(summary); // { pending: X, in_progress: Y, completed: Z, failed: W }
```

### Check Cost Accumulation
```sql
SELECT SUM(cost) as total_cost
FROM outcome_vectors
WHERE work_order_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM work_orders
  WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
);
```

### Check Failure Patterns
```sql
SELECT failure_class, COUNT(*)
FROM outcome_vectors
WHERE work_order_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM work_orders
  WHERE project_id = 'f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951'
)
AND failure_class IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY failure_class;
```
