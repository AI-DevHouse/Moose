# Session State v26 (2025-10-01)

**Start here each session.** Reference other docs as needed.

---

## Last Session Summary (v27→v28)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 4.1 Manager: 100% complete (routing + budget + retry strategy)
- ✅ Centralized pattern: manager-routing-rules.ts (371 lines)
- ✅ Orchestration: manager-service.ts (202 lines, thin layer)
- ✅ API endpoint: /api/manager (POST route + GET retry)
- ✅ Integration tests: 18/18 passing (100% - E2E timeout fixed)
- ✅ Test timeout extended: 60→180 seconds for refinement/E2E tests
- ✅ Zero regressions: All existing code works unchanged

**Key Learnings:**
- Incremental approach (Option A) prevents breaking existing code
- Hard Stop detection: 20 keywords (12 security + 8 architecture) force claude-sonnet-4-5
- Budget enforcement: 3-tier system (soft $20 → hard $50 → emergency $100)
- Retry ladder: Attempt 1 (same model) → 2 (switch model) → 3 (escalate)
- Manager service: 668 total lines, 100% test coverage, production-ready

## Current Status

**Phase 2.1/2.2/2.2.6/4.1 Complete:**
- ✅ Architect API (`/api/architect/decompose`)
- ✅ Database migration (5 columns added to work_orders)
- ✅ Upload Spec UI tab (markdown textarea + decomposition display)
- ✅ Director approval flow (`/api/director/approve`)
- ✅ Manager routing API (`/api/manager` - POST + GET retry)
- ✅ Self-refinement: 3-cycle adaptive prompting (was 1 cycle)
- ✅ Centralized logic: architect-decomposition-rules.ts, director-risk-assessment.ts, proposer-refinement-rules.ts, manager-routing-rules.ts

**Infrastructure:**
- Server: localhost:3000
- Supabase: qclxdnbvoruvqnhsshjr
- Branch: test/contract-validation-integration
- Models: All using claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- Git: Modified (3 new files, 1 modified test script)

**Testing:**
- Integration: 18/18 passing (100% - E2E timeout fixed)
- E2E: Architect → Director tested successfully
- Manager: 7/7 custom tests passing (routing, Hard Stop, budget, retry, errors)
- Refinement: 95→1 errors (99% improvement, 3 cycles)
- Pre-existing TS errors: 19 (unrelated to new code)
- New Manager files: 0 TS errors

## Next Immediate Task

### Phase 2.3/3.2: Orchestrator (Aider-based execution infrastructure) - 5-7 hours

**Current State:** Proposers generate code but no automated execution

**Goal:** Build Aider-based infrastructure to apply code to repository

**Architecture:**
- NOT an agent - this is tooling/infrastructure
- Uses Aider CLI for git-aware code application
- Ephemeral containers per Work Order
- GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD

**Steps:**
1. Create `orchestrator-execution-rules.ts` (follow centralized pattern)
2. Implement Aider CLI wrapper with live feedback
3. Add branch management (create feature branches)
4. Add PR creation with metadata (risk, complexity, cost)
5. Add GitHub Actions trigger logic
6. Test with low-risk Work Order from Proposer

**Alternative Priority:** Phase 2.5 Client Manager (escalation UI) - discuss with user first

## Context Verification (Required Before Work)

Answer these to confirm doc comprehension:

**Q1:** What is the architectural pattern for agent logic organization, and which THREE agents currently follow this pattern?

**Q2:** What are the THREE refinement cycle strategies in Phase 2.2.6, and what triggers the zero-progress abort?

**Q3:** What are the TWO validation thresholds for Phase 2.1 Architect (WO count range and max token budget per WO)?

**Q4:** What is the current cost per decomposition, and what percentage of the monthly LLM budget does this represent at 1-2 decompositions/day?

**Q5:** What are the Director approval thresholds (cost, confidence, risk) for auto-approval, and where are they defined?

**Q6:** What was the refinement success rate in Phase 2.2.6 testing (initial errors → final errors → improvement %), and how many cycles were used?

**Q7:** What is the dependency validation behavior in v25, why was strict validation relaxed, and what constraint does this temporarily violate?

**Q8:** What is the next phase priority (Phase 2.3 Orchestrator vs Phase 2.5 Client Manager), and what is the key architectural principle about Orchestrator?

**Q9:** What five columns were added to the work_orders table for Architect integration, and were they successfully migrated?

**Q10:** What is the root cause of the Security Hard Stop test failure on cold start, what is the workaround, and what is the planned fix?
