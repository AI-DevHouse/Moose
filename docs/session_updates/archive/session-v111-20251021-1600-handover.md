# Session v111 Handover — Priority 1 Analysis & Interactive Exemplar

**Session Date:** 2025-10-21 16:00
**Previous Session:** v110 (2025-10-21 17:00)
**Type:** Strategic Analysis & Quality Validation Experiment

---

## Result

✅ **SUCCESS** — Priority 1 analysis complete (prompt refinements insufficient), Claude A/B test conducted (marginal +8 pts improvement), interactive exemplar created scoring 94/100 (vs 66/100 automated), comprehensive strategy document produced for LLM discussion, confirmed Tier 3 Validator as mandatory path forward

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v110)

1. **Priority 1 analysis completed** — Analyzed acceptance scoring patterns across 3 complexity levels; extracted success patterns from low complexity (78/100: zero placeholders, excellent error handling) and failure patterns from mid/high (58/100, 44/100: missing tests, broken imports, no error handling); conclusion: gpt-4o-mini ignoring existing rules due to capability ceiling, not missing rules; prompt refinements alone insufficient
2. **Strategic decision framework created** — Comprehensive analysis document (23K words) with 5 solutions ranked by confidence/ROI, 7 critical issues identified, unknowns documented, decision matrix (Conservative vs Aggressive paths); evidence: `evidence/v111/comprehensive-analysis-and-strategy.md`, `decision-summary.md`, `tier1-prompt-improvement-principles.md`
3. **Claude A/B test completed** — Rapid reset performed, forced Claude via Supabase proposers table, approved same 3 WOs; results: Mid (0.55) 66/100 (+8 vs gpt-4o-mini but fails 75 target by -9), Low (0.41) 67/100 (-11 REGRESSION vs gpt-4o-mini), High (0.98) FAILED (PR body >65K chars); **both models 0/10 on tests identically**; average: Claude 66.5 vs gpt-4o-mini 68 = Claude 1.5 pts worse; evidence: `evidence/v111/claude-vs-gpt4o-mini-comparison.md`, `ab-test-summary.md`
4. **Interactive exemplar experiment conducted** — Rapid reset, implemented Redux Toolkit WO (mid 0.55) interactively with tool access and explicit rubric knowledge; self-scored 94/100 using same 10-criteria rubric; comparison: automated Claude 66/100 → interactive Claude 94/100 (+28 pts); critical difference: tests 0/10 → 10/10, documentation 2/10 → 9/10, error handling 5/10 → 9/10; PR #241 created with 554 lines (types, store, index, tests); evidence: `evidence/v111/exemplar-self-evaluation.md`, `exemplar-summary.md`
5. **Case study document created for LLM discussion** — 15K-word neutral analysis of interactive vs automated performance; 5 major findings, 5 discussion points, 12 questions for other LLMs; designed to provoke strategic discussion on root causes, scalability solutions, and validation strategies; evidence: `evidence/v111/interactive-vs-automated-case-study.md`
6. **Root cause confirmed** — Test generation failure is operational (models drop tests under cognitive load), not capability-based (interactive mode proves models CAN generate tests); pattern identical across gpt-4o-mini and Claude (both 0/10 on mid complexity); Tier 3 Validator mandatory to enforce test creation programmatically; routing fix alone insufficient (Claude +8 pts still fails 75/100 target)

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (v112 — 2 hours):** Discuss comprehensive analysis with other LLMs using case study document
   - Paste `evidence/v111/interactive-vs-automated-case-study.md` into Claude UI (fresh instance), GPT-4, or other LLMs
   - Ask specific questions: "Why do multiple models exhibit identical test generation failure?", "Which intervention would you prioritize?", "What's your interpretation of the root cause?"
   - Document responses in `evidence/v112/llm-discussion-responses.md`
   - Goal: Validate or challenge analysis conclusions with alternative perspectives

2. **PRIORITY 2 (v112 — 2 hours):** Implement PR body truncation fix for Claude high-complexity testing
   - Add truncation logic to `src/lib/orchestrator/github-integration.ts:237`
   - Logic: `if (prBody.length > 65000) prBody = prBody.substring(0, 65000) + '\n\n...(truncated)'`
   - Re-run WO-787c6dd1 (high 0.98) with Claude to complete A/B test
   - Document high-complexity results in `evidence/v112/claude-high-complexity-evaluation.md`

3. **PRIORITY 3 (v112-v113 — 10 hours):** Implement Tier 3 Programmatic Validator (CRITICAL)
   - Create `src/lib/completeness-validator.ts` with 5 validation checks: (1) test assertion count (min 3 per test), (2) placeholder detection (regex for comment-only methods, TODOs), (3) import validation (files exist), (4) error handling coverage (try-catch on fs.*, fetch, etc.), (5) type safety scan (detect `: any\b`)
   - Integrate into refinement loop in `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts` BEFORE syntax checking
   - Test on 10 WOs across all complexity levels (3 low, 4 mid, 3 high)
   - Measure: score improvement, cost impact (additional refinement cycles), refinement success rate
   - Expected: 75-85/100 on mid complexity with validator enforcement

4. **PRIORITY 4 (v113 — 4 hours):** Implement improved WO templates (if validator proves effective)
   - Create new template with: CRITICAL section at top (tests requirement explicit), explicit file structure (CREATE markers), concrete code examples, test requirements as separate section, success checklist
   - Pilot test on 5 WOs (2 low, 2 mid, 1 high) using new template
   - Measure: test generation rate, placeholder reduction, overall score improvement, token cost increase
   - Document results in `evidence/v113/wo-template-pilot-results.md`

5. **OPTIONAL (v113 — 2 hours):** Fix routing logic if cost/quality trade-off justified
   - Update `src/lib/manager-routing-rules.ts` to route: Low (<0.5) → gpt-4o-mini, Mid/High (≥0.5) → Claude
   - Only implement if Tier 3 validator proves insufficient OR cost increase acceptable
   - Cost impact: $0.05 → $0.50/WO average (10x increase)
   - Expected: +5-8 additional points on mid/high (beyond validator improvement)

## Watchpoints

1. **Tier 3 validator refinement loop risk** — If models receive validation errors but repeat same mistakes (don't successfully address feedback), validator becomes ineffective; mitigation: limit refinement attempts to 5, then escalate with detailed validation report; measure refinement success rate per error type in first 10 test WOs; if success rate <50%, reconsider validator design or add more specific feedback messaging
2. **WO template token budget overflow** — Improved templates with CRITICAL sections, examples, and explicit structure may exceed context windows for high complexity (>0.7); current budget: 6K tokens for WO, adding templates could push to 8-10K; verify on pilot test that high-complexity WOs don't exceed limits; if overflow occurs, implement template truncation or complexity-based template variants
3. **Interactive exemplar not generalizable** — Single WO test (n=1) with unique advantages (rubric visibility, tool access, 45 min time); pattern may not hold for other WOs or complexity levels; before claiming 94/100 is achievable target, test interactive mode on 3-5 additional WOs to confirm consistency; low sample size risk means exemplar demonstrates "what's possible" not "expected performance"
4. **Cost increase from validator may be non-linear** — Expected +1 refinement cycle (+40% cost) assumes validator catches issues early; if validator triggers multiple refinement cycles (3-5+) due to complex errors, cost could increase 2-3x; monitor cost per WO on first 10 validator tests; if avg cost >$0.15 for gpt-4o-mini or >$1.50 for Claude, may need to optimize validator feedback or reduce check strictness
5. **Test generation failure root cause uncertain** — Analysis suggests models drop tests under cognitive load, but alternative explanations exist (training data bias, sequential generation artifact, attention allocation); if validator enforcement doesn't improve test generation rate to >80%, root cause hypothesis may be wrong; plan alternative interventions if validator proves insufficient
