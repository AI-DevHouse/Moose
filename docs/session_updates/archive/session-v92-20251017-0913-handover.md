# SESSION V92 — HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v92-20251017-0913-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-17 09:13
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS – V91 branching fix validated, scale test blocked by metadata issues
**Version:** v92-validated

---

## 1. Δ SUMMARY (Since v91)

- **✅ BRANCHING FIX VALIDATED** – Single WO executed successfully end-to-end with NO git errors at Step 3 (branching from detached HEAD in worktree)
- **✅ Complete Pipeline Success** – WO 34879782 completed all 6 steps: routing → proposer → aider → GitHub → PR #107 → acceptance (4.5/10)
- **✅ Worktree Pool Stable** – Pool initialization consistent (25-31s for 3 worktrees), lease/release cycle working correctly
- **⚠️ Scale Test Incomplete** – 3-concurrent WO test blocked by Supabase metadata update failures (auto_approved flag not persisting)
- **✅ Cleanup Procedures Validated** – PR closed, remote branches deleted, local worktrees removed successfully

---

## 2. VALIDATION RESULTS

### Single WO Test (WO 34879782) ✅
**Title:** "Update README with project architecture overview"
**Total Time:** 111.6s (~1.9 minutes)
**PR:** https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1/pull/107 (closed after test)

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Pool Init:** 31s (3 worktrees created clean, no stale worktrees detected)
2. **Step 1 - Routing:** ~1s → gpt-4o-mini selected (complexity: 0.4)
3. **Step 2 - Proposer:** 66s → 3 refinement cycles, cost: 5.085e-7
4. **Step 3 - Aider (CRITICAL):** ~30s → **BRANCHING SUCCESS**
   - Worktree: C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1-wt-1 (detached HEAD)
   - Branch: feature/wo-34879782-update-readme-with-project-architecture-overview
   - **"Feature branch created successfully"** ← v91 fix working!
   - Git commit 632c288: "docs: Update README and add architecture documentation overview"
   - **NO GIT ERRORS** ✅
5. **Step 4 - GitHub Push:** ~5s → Branch pushed, PR #107 created
6. **Step 5 - Acceptance:** ~1s → Score: 4.5/10 (Architecture: 10/10, Readability: 10/10, Completeness: 2/10)
7. **Step 6 - Tracking:** ~1s → Results logged, status: needs_review

#### Worktree Lifecycle:
- **Lease:** wt-1 leased (2 available)
- **Cleanup:** 1697ms cleanup time
- **Release:** wt-1 returned to pool (3 available)

## 3. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V93)

1️⃣ **Investigate Metadata Update Failures** – Supabase `.update()` calls returning success but not persisting `auto_approved` flag in metadata JSONB column
   - Script: `scripts/fix-wo-metadata.ts` showed "✅ Fixed" but metadata remained empty
   - Possible causes: RLS policies, JSONB column behavior, transaction rollback
   - Workaround: Use existing `scripts/approve-latest-3-wos.ts` which DOES work (sets metadata directly)

2️⃣ **Complete Scale Test** – Retry 3-concurrent WO execution after fixing metadata issue
   - Expected behavior: All 3 worktrees leased simultaneously
   - Validate concurrent branching (3 different feature branches in 3 worktrees)
   - Confirm no resource contention or git locking issues

3️⃣ **Proposer Latency Investigation** (Optional) – 60-90s code generation time at Step 2
   - Check OPENAI_API_KEY validity
   - Monitor for rate limiting or network issues
   - Consider timeout adjustments if needed

4️⃣ **Document Fix** – Update `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts:104-125` with comments explaining the detached HEAD branching approach

---

## 4. WATCHPOINTS

- ✅ **V91 Branching Bug RESOLVED** – Worktrees with `--detach` can now create feature branches directly from detached HEAD
- ⚠️ **Metadata Update Mystery** – Supabase `update()` calls not persisting to database despite success response; needs investigation
- ⚠️ **Scale Test Pending** – 3-concurrent WO execution not yet validated (blocked by metadata issue, not by core functionality)
- ✅ **Cleanup Procedures** – PR/branch/worktree cleanup working correctly (tested manually in v92)
- ⚠️ **Context Limit** – Session at 120k/200k tokens used; keep v93 focused

---

## 5. FILES MODIFIED (V91 Fix)

### Primary Fix:
- **`src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts:104-125`**
  - **Before:** Attempted `git checkout main` in worktree (FAILED - main branch locked by parent repo)
  - **After:** Create feature branch directly from detached HEAD with `git checkout -b feature/...`
  - **Lines Changed:** Deleted 40+ lines of fallback logic, replaced with direct branching
  - **Status:** ✅ Validated working in v92

---

## 6. EVIDENCE

- **Success Log:** `docs/session_updates/evidence/v92/orchestrator-success.log`
- **PR (Closed):** https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1/pull/107
- **Git Commit:** 632c288 (in worktree wt-1, cleaned up after test)
- **Orchestrator Logs:** Captured in BashOutput during session
