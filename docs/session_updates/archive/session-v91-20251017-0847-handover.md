# SESSION V91 ‚Äî HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v91-20251017-0847-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-17 08:47
**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success ‚Äì Root cause identified and fixed, validation pending
**Version:** v91-partial

---

## 1. Œî SUMMARY (Since v90)

- **‚úÖ Root Cause Analysis Completed** ‚Äì Investigated branching failures: worktrees created with `--detach` flag have main branch locked by parent repo (`+ main`), preventing `git checkout main` in worktrees
- **‚úÖ Proper Fix Implemented** ‚Äì Modified `aider-executor.ts:104-125` to remove "checkout main" logic entirely; feature branches now created directly from detached HEAD (which is already at main's commit)
- **‚úÖ Clean State Restored** ‚Äì Deleted remote feature branch `feature/wo-73c43c90-*`, reset 8 failed WOs to pending, killed all stale orchestrator processes
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Incomplete** ‚Äì Fix implemented but not yet tested with full WO execution cycle (orchestrator startup interrupted before Step 3 completion)
- **üìä Worktree Pool Stable** ‚Äì Pool initialization consistently successful (14-21s for 3 worktrees with npm install), lease/release cycle working correctly

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V92)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Validate Branching Fix** ‚Äì Start fresh orchestrator, let 1 WO complete full cycle (routing ‚Üí proposer ‚Üí aider ‚Üí GitHub push), verify no git errors at Step 3

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Monitor Aider Execution** ‚Äì Watch for successful branch creation in detached HEAD worktree, confirm Aider can commit and that GitHub integration pushes correctly

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Scale Test** ‚Äì If 1 WO succeeds, approve 3 WOs and verify concurrent execution with worktree lease/release (should see all 3 worktrees in use simultaneously)

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Investigate Proposer Latency** ‚Äì Code generation taking 60+ seconds (Step 2); verify OPENAI_API_KEY valid, check for rate limiting or network issues

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Evidence Log** ‚Äì Save orchestrator output showing successful Step 3-5 execution to `evidence/v92/orchestrator-success.log`

---

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Aider + Detached HEAD** ‚Äì aider-executor.ts:125 now creates branches directly from detached HEAD (`git checkout -b feature/...`). If Aider fails to detect git repo, may need GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE env vars (already set at line 116-117).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Proposer API Latency** ‚Äì Step 2 (code generation) taking 60-90 seconds per WO. May indicate rate limiting, network issues, or OPENAI_API_KEY misconfiguration. Monitor for timeouts.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clean Worktree State** ‚Äì Worktrees wt-1/wt-2/wt-3 currently exist at `C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1-wt-*`. Next orchestrator start will remove and recreate them (adds 30-40s to startup).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Remote Branches** ‚Äì All remote feature branches cleaned up. First successful WO will push new branch to origin.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Context Limit Reached** ‚Äì Session approaching token limit (113k/200k used). Keep v92 focused on validation only.

- Evidence: Store v92 orchestrator logs under `evidence/v92/`
- Files Modified:
  - `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts:104-125` ‚Äì Removed "checkout main" logic, branch directly from detached HEAD
  - Lines changed: Deleted 40+ lines of fallback logic, replaced with direct `git checkout -b` command
- Git Investigation:
  - `git -C worktree-path branch -a` shows `+ main` = locked branch
  - `git -C worktree-path rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns `HEAD` (detached)
