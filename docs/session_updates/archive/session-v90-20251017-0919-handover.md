# SESSION V90 — HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v90-20251017-0919-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-17 09:19
**Result:** ⚠️ Partial Success – Worktree pool initialized, blocked by Next.js build issue
**Version:** v90-partial

---

## 1. Δ SUMMARY (Since v89)

- **✅ Environment Variable Loading Fixed** – Modified `proposer-registry.ts` to use lazy initialization (`getSupabase()` function), updated `package.json` orchestrator script to use `tsx --env-file=.env.local` flag
- **✅ Worktree Pool Initialized** – Successfully initialized 3 worktrees at `C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1-wt-{1,2,3}` with npm install (14s, 9s, 9s respectively)
- **✅ isEnabled() Bug Fixed** – Modified `worktree-pool.ts:519-521` to check `process.env.WORKTREE_POOL_ENABLED` directly instead of relying on instance variable set during initialize()
- **✅ Test Work Orders Created & Approved** – Created 3 WOs with `scripts/create-worktree-test-wos.ts`, approved with `scripts/approve-latest-3-wos.ts` (a7bb6c49, 24f96d7f, 92a9c7c1)
- **✅ Git State Reset** – Reset failed WOs (11 total), reset local multi-llm-discussion-v1 to origin/main, deleted 3 remote feature branches
- **❌ BLOCKED: Next.js Build Issue** – Orchestrator picked up 3 WOs but all failed at routing stage with 500 error: "Cannot find module './chunks/vendor-chunks/next.js'" (corrupted .next build folder)

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V91)

1️⃣ **Fix Next.js Build** – Complete `npm run build` (was interrupted at type-checking stage), verify .next folder structure is correct

2️⃣ **Start Next.js Dev Server** – Run `npm run dev` in background to enable manager routing API (orchestrator calls localhost:3000/api/manager/route)

3️⃣ **Kill Stale Orchestrator Processes** – Check for multiple background orchestrators (IDs: 426192, 458c89, 01400c, 69ca61, a80c3c), kill all except latest

4️⃣ **Reset WO Status** – Reset the 3 test WOs back to pending (currently stuck in "in_progress" from failed routing attempts)

5️⃣ **Monitor Worktree Pool Execution** – Watch `orchestrator-v90.log` for worktree lease/release cycle, verify isolation, measure cleanup time

6️⃣ **Scale Testing** – If 3 WOs succeed, increase to 10 WOs and verify queue blocking behavior

---

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- ⚠️ **Next.js Build Corruption** – The .next folder is missing vendor-chunks/next.js module. May need `rm -rf .next && npm run build` to fully reset build cache.
- ⚠️ **Multiple Orchestrator Instances** – Session had 5+ attempts to start orchestrator due to env var issues. Kill all background processes before restarting to avoid double-processing WOs.
- ⚠️ **Manager API Dependency** – Orchestrator cannot route WOs without Next.js server running. All 3 WOs failed with 500 error when trying to call routing decision endpoint.
- ⚠️ **3 WOs in Failed State** – Work orders a7bb6c49, 24f96d7f, 92a9c7c1 are marked as failed at "routing" stage. Reset to pending after fixing build.
- ⚠️ **Worktree Pool Ready** – Pool is fully initialized and waiting. No need to reinitialize—just fix Next.js and restart orchestrator.

  - `scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts:19` – Added comment about tsx --env-file loading
  - `package.json:15` – Added orchestrator script with proper env file flag
- Scripts Created:
  - `scripts/create-worktree-test-wos.ts` – Creates 3 test WOs with worktree_pool_test metadata
  - `scripts/approve-latest-3-wos.ts` – Approves 3 most recent pending WOs
  - `scripts/approve-worktree-test-wos.ts` – Approves WOs with specific test metadata
