# Session v104 Handover — Status State Machine Complete + Proposer Extraction Issue Found

**Session Date:** 2025-10-17 16:00
**Previous Session:** v102 (2025-10-17 21:45)
**Type:** Complete Option A State Machine + Validation Run

---

## Result

⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** — Status state machine working perfectly, but validation uncovered critical proposer extraction issue

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v102)

1. **Completed Option A status state machine** — Prior session updated poller to query `status='approved'`; this session added orchestrator logic to set `status='in_progress'` on execution start (orchestrator-service.ts:237-242); clean flow now: `pending → approved → in_progress → completed/failed/needs_review`
2. **Created migration script** — scripts/migrate-to-status-state-machine.ts converts legacy `metadata.auto_approved=true` WOs to `status='approved'`; migrated 3 WOs successfully; no more hidden approval state in JSONB metadata
3. **Validation run completed** — Approved 6 WOs; orchestrator picked up all 6 immediately; 5 PRs created (#141-145); 1 WO failed with "No commits between branches" (Aider made no changes); status transitions working correctly (0 approved remaining, 5 in needs_review, 1 failed)
4. **Dependency context fix validated** — Server logs show correct project path used: "Using project path for dependency context: C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1" (not orchestrator's path); **no TS2307 errors** related to dependency imports; v102 fix is working
5. **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED** — All 6 WOs hit proposer extraction validator errors: "Invalid first character: '{' or '#' - may be markdown artifact"; gpt-4o-mini returning code wrapped in markdown that sanitizer cannot clean; residual TS errors: 2, 4, 11, 13, 23, 58 across WOs; Aider succeeded anyway by interpreting intent, but code quality questionable

---

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (immediate):** Fix proposer extraction/markdown handling
   - Review extraction-validator.ts and sanitizer logic for '{' and '#' prefixes
   - Test with gpt-4o-mini responses to understand markdown wrapping patterns
   - Consider adding pre-extraction markdown unwrapping (strip leading/trailing ```json, ```typescript, etc.)
   - Goal: Clean extraction on first pass, eliminate residual TS syntax errors

2. **PRIORITY 2 (1-2 hours):** Validate extraction fix
   - Reset failed/needs_review WOs back to pending
   - Re-approve 3-5 WOs and monitor for extraction issues
   - Target: 0 extraction validation warnings, <5% TS error rate after refinement
   - Document in `evidence/v104/extraction-fix-validation.md`

3. **PRIORITY 3 (deferred from v101):** Phase 2 supervised learning scripts
   - scripts/cleanup-iteration.ts (database, GitHub, filesystem cleanup)
   - scripts/run-iteration.ts (full cycle: init → execute → test)
   - scripts/score-iteration.ts (wrapper for iteration-scorer.ts)
   - scripts/supervised-loop.ts (main orchestrator with human approval)

4. **MAINTENANCE:** Update SOURCE_OF_TRUTH documentation
   - Document Option A status state machine architecture
   - Add troubleshooting section for status-based workflow
   - Archive session handovers v79-v100 to `archive/`

## Watchpoints

1. **Extraction validator may have regressed** — Lines 341-471 in Server Logs show multiple CRITICAL extraction issues; sanitizer auto-clean failing; may need complete rewrite of markdown artifact detection logic
2. **Aider masking proposer failures** — 5 WOs succeeded despite 2-58 TS errors because Aider interprets broken code; acceptance scores will be low (4.5/10, 3.8/10 seen); cannot rely on Aider to compensate for proposer quality issues
3. **Missing complexity_learning_samples table** — Server logs show "Could not find table 'public.complexity_learning_samples' in schema cache"; non-fatal but prevents learning telemetry; may need schema migration
4. **Status state machine migration incomplete** — Only migrated 3 WOs with auto_approved=true; other legacy approval patterns (approved_by_director, director_approved) may exist in older WOs; run migration script again if poller finds 0 WOs unexpectedly
5. **v102 priority (dependency validation) was skipped** — Original v102 handover requested validation of dependency context fix with <30% TS2307 rate; this session confirmed no TS2307 errors, but proposer extraction issues prevent accurate success rate measurement
