**Result:** ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - Bootstrap system deployed, 49 WOs populated with technical_requirements

**Δ Summary:**
- Deployed bootstrap system code: regenerated Supabase types, replaced decompose route with updated version (conflict detection + bootstrap execution)
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors: added type casts for JSONB fields (ConflictReport, AggregatedRequirements, BootstrapResult as any)
- Generated technical_requirements for all 60 WOs using Claude Sonnet 4 analysis (npm deps, dev deps, env vars, external services, tsconfig)
- Cleaned up database: deleted 11 test WOs including WO-0 (14b6ea23), retained 49 original production WOs from Oct 10
- Verified database state: decomposition_metadata, bootstrap_events tables exist; all 49 WOs have populated technical_requirements

**Next Actions:**
1. Test requirements aggregation: run aggregator on 49 WOs, verify conflict detection logic (version mismatches, framework conflicts, JSX mismatches)
2. Test conflict blocking: verify WOs with critical conflicts marked as `blocked_by_conflicts`, stored in decomposition_metadata table
3. Test bootstrap execution: create clean test project directory, trigger bootstrap, verify package.json/tsconfig/src/ created with correct dependencies
4. Monitor decomposition_metadata and bootstrap_events tables during testing for proper event logging
5. Test conflict resolution flow: use `/api/architect/resolve-conflicts` endpoint, edit WO requirements, verify re-aggregation and bootstrap execution

**Watchpoints:**
- Bootstrap API adds 2-5 min response time (synchronous npm install) - verify 300s timeout configured in route maxDuration
- Type casts (`as any`) bypass TypeScript safety - acceptable for JSONB but monitor for runtime errors in conflict/bootstrap data structures
- 49 WOs share consistent base stack (Electron 27, React 18.2, TypeScript 5.3) - ideal for testing aggregation without conflicts
- Decompose route is breaking change from v128 - old route backed up to route.ts.backup, rollback available if issues found
- Technical requirements generated by LLM inference may have minor inaccuracies - spot-check sample WOs if aggregation produces unexpected conflicts
