# Session v142 Handover — 2025-10-29 14:45

## Result
⚠️ **Investigation incomplete; bootstrap architecture questions raised but not resolved**

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v141)
- User provided critical architecture clarifications:
  * Orchestrator must be running for bootstrap execution
  * Bootstrap WOs should not execute via normal work_orders flow (or need special handling)
  * Main WOs should be marked in_progress during bootstrap to prevent simultaneous execution
  * After bootstrap completes, main WOs marked approved for orchestrator pickup
- Confirmed GitHub main branch clean (only README at commit 74709c2)
- Found local repo has uncommitted bootstrap files (package.json, tsconfig.json, .env.example, .gitignore) requiring cleanup
- Discovered project ID confusion: previous sessions queried wrong project (test project 06b35034 with 1 WO vs multi-llm-discussion-v1 f73e8c9f with 49 WOs)
- Located orchestrator code (orchestrator-service.ts:135) - polls for pending WOs with status filtering

## Next Actions
1. **Query database state for correct project** (f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951)
   - Check decomposition_metadata: bootstrap_needed, bootstrap_executed, bootstrap_commit_hash
   - Check bootstrap_events: any execution attempts/failures
   - Get all 49 work_orders with current status breakdown
2. **Understand bootstrap execution flow**
   - Read orchestrator code to identify bootstrap WO handling logic
   - Determine if bootstrap is orchestrator-driven or separate mechanism
   - Identify how bootstrap WOs are distinguished from main WOs (title keywords? separate status? metadata flag?)
3. **Clean local repository**
   - Run: `git -C C:/dev/multi-llm-discussion-v1 status` to confirm uncommitted files
   - Run: `git -C C:/dev/multi-llm-discussion-v1 reset --hard HEAD` to clean working directory
4. **Execute bootstrap** (once mechanism understood)
   - Start orchestrator daemon if required
   - Monitor bootstrap execution and commit to main branch
   - Verify infrastructure files created (package.json, tsconfig.json, src/)
5. **Manage main WO statuses**
   - After bootstrap completes: ensure main WOs are `approved` (not `in_progress`)
   - Verify dependencies properly block WOs until bootstrap merged

## Watchpoints
- **Bootstrap execution mechanism unclear** - need code investigation to understand orchestrator's role vs separate process
- **Project ID consistency** - all scripts must use f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951 (not test project 06b35034)
- **decomposition_metadata.bootstrap_executed is authoritative** - not work_orders.status for bootstrap WO
- **Local repo has stale uncommitted files** - must clean before bootstrap re-execution
- **WO status management during bootstrap** - user's architecture suggests blocking mechanism needed to prevent main WOs executing during bootstrap
- **v141 handover incorrectly reported "bootstrap in progress"** - was checking wrong project/mixing local git state with remote
