2. ‚úÖ Reset database work orders
   - Reset 37 failed WOs to pending
   - Reset 12 in_progress WOs to pending
   - All 49 WOs now in pending status
   - 5 WOs marked with `auto_approved: true` for Phase 1

3. ‚úÖ Configured routing for Phase 1 test
   - Disabled GPT-4o-mini proposer (`active: false`)
   - All WOs will now route to Claude Sonnet 4.5
   - Verified routing with check-routing.ts script

4. ‚úÖ Pre-flight verification
   - Build successful (npm run build - 0 errors)
   - Moose UI running at http://localhost:3001
   - Target repo verified clean
   - Database verified ready

5. ‚úÖ Created cleanup scripts
   - `scripts/approve-phase1-wos.ts` - Mark WOs as auto_approved
   - `scripts/disable-gpt-proposer.ts` - Disable GPT for testing
   - `scripts/check-routing.ts` - Verify proposer routing
   - `scripts/check-projects.ts` - View project configurations
   - `scripts/reset-failed-wos.ts` - Updated to reset in_progress WOs too

## üéØ BUGS FIXED / ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue 1: v68 Cleanup Was Skipped
**Problem:** Session v68 failed because manual cleanup from v67 fix plan was skipped
- 48 local branches remained
- 46 remote branches on GitHub
- 25 open PRs
- Dirty target repo with untracked files from failed v68 runs

**Resolution:**
- Implemented complete cleanup procedure
- Verified target repo is pristine
- All branches and PRs removed

### Issue 2: Work Orders Stuck in Failed/In-Progress State
**Problem:** 37 failed + 12 in_progress WOs from v68 run

**Resolution:**
- Updated reset-failed-wos.ts to handle both failed and in_progress
- All 49 WOs reset to pending
- 5 WOs approved for Phase 1 via metadata.auto_approved

### Issue 3: Mixed Model Routing for Phase 1
**Problem:** Initial Phase 1 routing would use both Claude and GPT-4o-mini
- 2 WOs ‚Üí Claude (complexity 0.88-0.9)
- 3 WOs ‚Üí GPT-4o-mini (complexity 0)

**Resolution:**
- Disabled GPT-4o-mini proposer for Phase 1
- Verified all 5 WOs now route to Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Plan: Re-enable GPT for Phase 2 to compare quality

## üöÄ NEXT SESSION INSTRUCTIONS

### Immediate Actions (DO IN ORDER)

**User will start Phase 1 orchestrator in new Claude Code window:**

1. **Start Orchestrator (Background)**
   ```bash
   cd C:/dev/moose-mission-control
   powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/orchestrator-daemon.ts
   # Use run_in_background: true
   ```

2. **Monitor Execution**
   - Open http://localhost:3001 in browser
   - Watch work orders progress in real-time
   - Expected duration: 5-10 minutes (5 WOs)
   - Expected cost: ~$5-10 (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

3. **Stop and Analyze (When Phase 1 Complete)**
   - DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 immediately
   - User will analyze generated code quality
   - Capture code samples for comparison

4. **Phase 2 Preparation (After Analysis)**
   ```bash
   # Enable GPT-4o-mini, disable Claude
   cd C:/dev/moose-mission-control
   powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 -c "
   npx tsx -e \"
   import { createSupabaseServiceClient } from './src/lib/supabase.js';
   const supabase = createSupabaseServiceClient();

   // Disable Claude
   await supabase.from('proposer_configs')
     .update({ active: false })
     .eq('name', 'claude-sonnet-4-5');

   // Enable GPT
   await supabase.from('proposer_configs')
     .update({ active: true })
     .eq('name', 'gpt-4o-mini');

   console.log('‚úÖ Switched to GPT-4o-mini for Phase 2');
   \"
   "

   # Reset 5 completed WOs back to pending
   # Mark same 5 WOs as auto_approved again
   # Restart orchestrator
   ```

### Success Criteria

**Phase 1 (Claude Sonnet 4.5):**
- Success Rate: ‚â•80% (4-5 of 5 WOs complete)
- Cost: <$15
- No PR conflicts or branch errors
- Code builds successfully

**Phase 2 (GPT-4o-mini):**
- Success Rate: ‚â•80% (4-5 of 5 WOs complete)
- Cost: <$5 (GPT is cheaper)
- Compare: Code quality, test coverage, error patterns

**Overall Goal:**
- Determine which model produces higher quality code
- Establish baseline for future routing decisions
- Validate cleanup procedure worked

## üîç CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Target Repo Had Untracked Files from v68

**Discovery:**
- Target repo (C:/dev/multi-llm-discussion-v1) had extensive folder structure
- Files were untracked (not committed), left over from v68 failed runs
- These were created by aider on feature branches that were later deleted
- When branches deleted, files remained as untracked

**Impact:**
- Would contaminate Phase 1 test results
- Not a clean baseline for testing

**Resolution:**
- Used `git clean -fdx` to remove all untracked files
- Verified only README.md remains
- Established pristine baseline for Phase 1

### Finding 2: Repo Path Configuration in Database

**Discovery:**
- Target repo path not in .env.local
- Stored in `projects` table in Supabase
- Project ID: f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951
- Local path: C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1

**How It Works:**
1. Each WO has `project_id` field
2. Aider executor queries: `SELECT local_path FROM projects WHERE id = {project_id}`
3. Executes aider in that directory (src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts:181)

**Documentation:**
- Added to session notes for future reference
- Created check-projects.ts script to view configuration

### Finding 3: Remote Branch Cleanup Required

**Discovery:**
- Closing PRs with `-d` flag only deletes remote branches for PRs
- Many remote branches remained after PR closure
- Had to manually delete 46 remote branches
- Default branch was set to a feature branch (blocking deletion)

**Resolution:**
1. Pushed local main to GitHub
2. Changed default branch to main via gh API
3. Deleted all remote feature/wo-* branches
4. Verified only main branch remains

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Phase 1 & 2 Test Strategy

**Purpose:** Compare code quality between Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4o-mini

**Approach:**
- **Same 5 work orders** for both phases
- **Same clean baseline** (pristine repo state)
- **Measure:**
  - Success rate (how many complete)
  - Code quality (functionality, tests, structure)
  - Cost per WO
  - Execution time

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Claude: Higher quality, higher cost (~$2-3 per WO)
- GPT-4o-mini: Faster, cheaper (~$0.20-0.50 per WO), possibly lower quality
- Data informs future routing threshold adjustments

### Routing Fallback Behavior Verified

**Question:** What happens when proposer is `active: false`?

**Answer:** Automatic fallback to next available proposer
- Lines 145-150 in manager-routing-rules.ts
- If no proposer can handle complexity, uses highest capability
- **Result:** All WOs route to remaining active proposer (Claude)

**Tested:** ‚úÖ Confirmed all 5 WOs route to Claude when GPT disabled
