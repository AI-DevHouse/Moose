# SESSION V95 — HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v95-20251017-1015-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-17 10:15
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS – Worktree Pool implementation status assessed and documented
**Version:** v95-status-assessment

---

## 1. Δ SUMMARY (Since v94)

- **✅ Worktree Pool Status Assessment COMPLETED** – Comprehensive review against implementation plan showing ~75% completion
- **✅ Implementation Plan Updated** – Added detailed status report to `docs/Worktree-Pool-Implementation-Plan.md` (lines 514-671)
- **✅ Phase 1 & 2 Confirmed COMPLETE** – Core WorktreePoolManager (524 lines) + full integration with Orchestrator/Aider/GitHub validated
- **⚠️ Phase 3 Identified as PARTIAL** – Missing automated health check loop and structured metrics emission
- **⚠️ Phase 4 Testing Gaps Identified** – Only 3/15 worktrees tested, no unit tests, no 500 WO acceptance batch yet
- **✅ V94 Scale Test Success Validated** – 3-concurrent execution proven with zero branch contamination, zero resource contention

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V96)

**Critical Path to Production (per updated implementation plan):**

1️⃣ **Scale Pool to 15 Worktrees** – Highest priority
   - Modify orchestrator daemon to initialize pool with 15 worktrees (currently hardcoded to 3)
   - Test pool initialization time (target: <5 min, expect ~150s based on v94 extrapolation)
   - Measure disk usage (target: ≤2GB)

2️⃣ **Run 15-Concurrent WO Test** – Validate full pool capacity
   - Approve 15 fresh pending WOs
   - Monitor pool saturation, queuing behavior
   - Verify no resource contention at scale
   - Measure cleanup time per worktree (target: <10s)

3️⃣ **Add Unit Tests** – Quality gate
   - Create `tests/lib/orchestrator/worktree-pool.test.ts`
   - Test initialization, lease/release, cleanup, concurrent operations
   - Test pool exhaustion and queuing behavior

4️⃣ **Add Health Monitoring** – Observability gap
   - Implement 60s health check loop (per plan lines 417-435)
   - Add structured metrics: `worktree.pool.available`, `worktree.lease.duration`, etc.
   - Alert if worktrees stuck (leased >20min) or pool exhausted >5min

5️⃣ **Run 500 WO Acceptance Test** – Final validation (optional, may defer)
   - Target: ≤8 hours execution time (vs 14 hour baseline)
   - Verify zero branch contamination at scale
   - Confirm all PRs created successfully

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- ✅ **Phases 1 & 2 Production-Ready** – Core manager and integration fully implemented and tested at small scale (3 WOs)
- ⚠️ **Scale Validation Incomplete** – Only 3/15 worktrees tested; pool capacity, initialization time, disk usage not measured at target scale
- ⚠️ **No Unit Test Coverage** – `worktree-pool.test.ts` does not exist; relying on manual integration tests only
- ⚠️ **Health Monitoring Gap** – Pool status logged manually, but no automated 60s check loop or metrics emission for production observability
- ⚠️ **500 WO Batch Not Run** – Primary success criterion (≤8 hours) not validated; small-scale tests (3 WOs) show promising baseline (~2.7 min/WO)

---

## 4. FILES MODIFIED (V95)

- **Updated:** `docs/Worktree-Pool-Implementation-Plan.md` – Added comprehensive status report (lines 514-671)
- **Created:** `docs/session_updates/session-v95-20251017-1015-handover.md` – This handover document
