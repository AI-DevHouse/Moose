# SESSION V80 - PHASE 1 & 2 TEST REPORT
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Test Type:** Phase 1 (Code Sanitizer) & Phase 2 (Learning Pipeline) Validation
**Result:** ✅ Core functionality working, ⚠️ Minor issues found

---

## TEST SETUP

1. **System Reset:** Full reset completed - 49 work orders reset to pending, 6 PRs closed, 12 branches deleted
2. **Test Sample:** 5 work orders approved and forced to GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective testing
3. **Daemon:** Orchestrator daemon ran successfully and processed all 5 work orders
4. **Validation:** Queried proposer_failures, proposer_attempts, and proposer_success_metrics tables

---

## RESULTS SUMMARY

### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS

#### 1. Logger (proposer-failure-logger.ts)
- **Status:** ✅ Fully functional
- **Evidence:** All 5 proposals logged to database
- **Sampling:** Correctly applied (100% failures, 10% successes)
- **Tables:** Both `proposer_failures` and `proposer_attempts` populated

#### 2. Complexity Scoring
- **Status:** ✅ Accurate
- **Scores:** 0.261, 0.362, 0.428, 0.432, 0.44
- **Bands:** Correctly assigned (0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5)

#### 3. Refinement Tracking
- **Status:** ✅ Working
- **Cycles:** All proposals went through 3 refinement cycles (max allowed)
- **Error Tracking:**
  - WO 1: 90 initial → 44 final (51% reduction)
  - WO 2: 80 initial → 16 final (80% reduction)
  - WO 3: 47 initial → 8 final (83% reduction)
  - WO 4: 41 initial → 10 final (76% reduction)
  - WO 5: 49 initial → 22 final (55% reduction)

#### 4. Failure Classification
- **Status:** ✅ Working
- **All Failures:** Correctly classified as "syntax_error"
- **Logic:** Classification based on error code analysis (TS1xxx = syntax)

#### 5. Rolling Window (proposer_attempts)
- **Status:** ✅ Functional
- **Records:** 5 attempts logged with sequence numbers
- **Cleanup:** Designed for 50-record window (not yet tested at scale)

## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

### Issue #1: Work Order IDs Not Captured
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Cannot link failures back to specific work orders
**Evidence:**
```
Work Order: N/A (should show WO ID like ca68150a...)
```
**Root Cause:** `work_order_id` is undefined/null when passed to logger
**Fix Location:** `enhanced-proposer-service.ts:372-379` - Ensure `request.metadata?.work_order_id` is correctly populated
**File:** enhanced-proposer-service.ts:373

---

### Issue #2: Sanitizer Telemetry Not Stored
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Cannot track which sanitizer corrections were applied
**Evidence:**
```
Sanitizer: 0 functions (should show changes like "Smart quotes → ASCII")
```
**Root Cause:** Sanitizer runs and logs to console, but telemetry isn't included in `RefinementResult` object
**Fix Needed:**
1. Add sanitizer telemetry to `RefinementResult` interface in `proposer-refinement-rules.ts:27-49`
2. Return sanitizer summary from `attemptSelfRefinement()` at lines 379-389
3. Pass sanitizer data to logger in `enhanced-proposer-service.ts:372-379`

**Files to Modify:**
- `proposer-refinement-rules.ts:27` (add sanitizer fields to RefinementResult)
- `proposer-refinement-rules.ts:379` (return sanitizer telemetry)
- `enhanced-proposer-service.ts:372` (pass sanitizer metadata to logger)

---

### Issue #3: ProposerExecutor Logging Mismatch
**Severity:** Low (cosmetic)
**Impact:** Confusing logs - shows 0 cycles but database shows 3
**Evidence:**
```
[ProposerExecutor] Code generated for WO xxx: { refinement_cycles: 0 }
(but database shows refinement_count: 3)
```
**Root Cause:** ProposerExecutor logs before refinement happens
**Fix Location:** `proposer-executor.ts` (log after refinement, not before)
**Note:** Non-blocking, just misleading console output

---

## DATABASE VALIDATION

### proposer_failures Table
```
✅ 5 records logged
✅ Complexity scores: accurate
✅ Complexity bands: correct
✅ Error counts: tracked correctly
✅ Refinement counts: all 3 cycles
✅ Failure category: all "syntax_error"
⚠️ work_order_id: all NULL (should be populated)
⚠️ sanitizer_changes: all empty (should show fixes)
⚠️ sanitizer_functions_triggered: all 0 (should be >0 if fixes made)
```

### proposer_attempts Table
```
✅ 5 records logged
✅ Proposer name: gpt-4o-mini
✅ Complexity bands: correct
✅ Final errors: tracked
✅ Refinement counts: all 3
⚠️ work_order_id: all NULL
```

### proposer_success_metrics Table
```
⚠️ No records found
Reason: This table is for aggregated metrics (Phase 3 enhancement)
Expected: Will be populated by meta-AI learning loop analyzer
```

---

## SANITIZER STATUS

### Code Sanitizer (code-sanitizer.ts)
- **Implementation:** ✅ Complete (13 correction functions)
- **Integration:** ✅ Called in proposer-refinement-rules.ts (lines 215 & 295)
- **Console Logging:** ✅ Works (lines 217 & 297 log changes)
- **Telemetry Return:** ⚠️ Not passed to RefinementResult
- **Database Storage:** ⚠️ Not logged to proposer_failures table

**Sanitizer runs 2 times per proposal:**
1. Line 215: Before initial TypeScript check (pre-refinement)
2. Line 295: After each refinement cycle (post-refinement)

**But telemetry is lost because:**
- RefinementResult doesn't have sanitizer fields
- attemptSelfRefinement() doesn't return sanitizer summary
- Logger receives no sanitizer metadata

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Fix Missing Data (Before Phase 3)
1. **Add work_order_id tracking**
   - File: `enhanced-proposer-service.ts:372`
   - Change: Pass `work_order_id: request.metadata?.work_order_id` to logger
   - Test: Run 1-2 proposals and verify WO IDs appear in database

2. **Add sanitizer telemetry to RefinementResult**
   - File: `proposer-refinement-rules.ts:27-49`
   - Add fields:
     ```typescript
     sanitizer_metadata?: {
       initial_changes: string[];
       cycle_changes: Array<{cycle: number; changes: string[]}>;
       total_functions_triggered: number;
     }
     ```
   - Update `attemptSelfRefinement()` to track and return sanitizer data
   - Pass to logger in `enhanced-proposer-service.ts:372-379`

3. **Fix ProposerExecutor logging**
   - File: `proposer-executor.ts`
   - Move refinement_cycles log AFTER refinement completes

### Priority 2: Test Phase 1 & 2 Again
After fixes:
- Run 3-5 new work orders
- Verify work_order_id is populated
- Verify sanitizer telemetry is stored
- Check if any proposals trigger sanitizer corrections

### Priority 3: Proceed to Phase 3
Once Phase 1 & 2 data is clean:
- Implement `prompt-enhancement-analyzer.ts` (Component 10)
- Create prompt injection system for buildClaudePrompt/buildOpenAIPrompt
- Wire analyzer into weekly cron job
- Test meta-AI learning loop

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION
- `scripts/check-proposer-learning.ts` (NEW) - Database query script
- `scripts/full-system-reset.ts` (READ) - System reset for testing
- `scripts/approve-phase1-wos.ts` (READ) - Approval script for testing

---

## CONCLUSION

**Phase 1 (Sanitizer) Status:** ✅ Implemented and running, ⚠️ telemetry not logged
**Phase 2 (Learning Pipeline) Status:** ✅ Working, capturing refinement data
**Critical Issues:** 2 medium-severity (work_order_id, sanitizer telemetry)
**Recommendation:** Fix Issues #1 & #2 before continuing to Phase 3

**Overall:** Core learning system is functional and capturing refinement data. Minor fixes needed to complete Phase 1 & 2 data capture before proceeding with Phase 3 (Meta-AI Learning Loop).
