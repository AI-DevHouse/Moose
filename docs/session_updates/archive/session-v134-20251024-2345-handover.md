**Result:** ✅ Architect self-correction validation system implemented and integrated

**Δ Summary:**
- Implemented architect-package-validator.ts (485 lines) with npm validation and architect API correction calls for invalid packages
- Integrated validation into decompose route at line 290 (post-decomposition, pre-aggregation) with auto-approval bypass
- WOs with invalid packages trigger architect correction prompt → architect revises technical_requirements → WO updated in DB → auto-approved
- Test validation: Detected invalid packages in 49/49 WOs, architect correction calls executed (HTTP 401 - OPENROUTER_API_KEY not configured)
- Updated SESSION_START_QUICK.md to reference v133 handover

**Next Actions:**
1. Configure OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env.local for architect correction API calls
2. Test full decompose flow with valid API key: Create small test spec → decompose → verify architect fixes packages → check auto-approval
3. Run orchestrator on auto-approved WOs to validate corrected technical_requirements execute successfully
4. Review architect correction quality: Manually inspect 3-5 corrected WOs to verify fixes preserve intent (e.g., jest-coverage-threshold removal/replacement)
5. Add architect model to project settings table (currently hardcoded 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet' at decompose route:299)

**Watchpoints:**
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable missing in test - verify .env.local has correct key name and value
- Architect correction adds 2-5s latency per problematic WO (49 WOs = 2.4 min) - acceptable for decomposition but monitor at scale
- Pre-proposer validation still active in orchestrator-service.ts:278 - now redundant, consider removing or simplifying to consistency-only checks
- Correction prompt quality critical - if architect fails to fix after 1 attempt, WO blocked (no retry logic)
- All 49 multi-llm-discussion-v1 WOs have version mismatches - first real test will correct all simultaneously
