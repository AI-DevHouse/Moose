# Session v102 Handover — Dependency Context Root Cause Fix

**Session Date:** 2025-10-17 21:45
**Previous Session:** v101 (2025-10-17 19:30)
**Type:** Root Cause Analysis & Critical Fix — TS2307 Dependency Errors

---

## Result

⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** — Root cause identified and fixed, but validation blocked by orphaned WOs; full system reset completed

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v101)

1. **Validated dependency context issue** — Ran 3 test WOs with v101 code; confirmed TS2307 errors at 100% rate (all 3 WOs failed with "Cannot find module"); proposer hallucinated modules from orchestrator that don't exist in target project
2. **Identified root cause** — `buildDependencyContext()` reads `process.cwd()/package.json` (moose-mission-control) instead of target project's package.json (multi-llm-discussion-v1); LLM receives wrong dependencies and tries to import `@/lib/supabase`, `@/types/parser` which don't exist in target
3. **Implemented multi-project dependency fix** — Changed cache to `Map<string, string>` for per-project support; added project path lookup from work_order_id; dynamic module discovery scans actual files in target project (replaces hardcoded list); passes projectPath through entire call chain
4. **Full system reset completed** — Reset 57 WOs to pending, closed 4 PRs (#137-140), cleaned target repo to main branch, deleted 5 feature branches; repository ready for fresh validation run
5. **Validation blocked** — 4 WOs stuck "in_progress" from killed orchestrator prevented testing fix; created evidence report with before/after analysis in `evidence/v102/dependency-fix-validation.md`

---

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (immediate):** Validate dependency context fix
   - Approve 2-3 fresh code-heavy WOs (avoid the 4 that were stuck)
   - Monitor server logs for TS2307 errors
   - Target: <30% TS2307 rate (down from 100%)
   - Document results in `evidence/v102/fix-validation-results.md`

2. **PRIORITY 2 (1-2 hours):** If fix validates successfully
   - Update SOURCE_OF_TRUTH with "Dependency Context Per-Project" architecture
   - Add troubleshooting guide for multi-project scenarios
   - Consider adding unit test for `buildDependencyContext()` with mock projects

3. **PRIORITY 3 (deferred from v101):** Implement Phase 2 supervised learning scripts
   - scripts/cleanup-iteration.ts (database, GitHub, filesystem cleanup)
   - scripts/run-iteration.ts (full cycle: init → execute → test)
   - scripts/score-iteration.ts (wrapper for iteration-scorer.ts)
   - scripts/supervised-loop.ts (main orchestrator with human approval)

4. **PRIORITY 4 (maintenance):** Archive old session files
   - Move handovers v79-v99 to `archive/` (keep v100-v102)
   - Clean up orphaned evidence folders

## Watchpoints

1. **Fix may not fully resolve TS2307** — Dynamic module discovery depends on target project having consistent directory structure (lib/, types/); some projects may use different layouts (e.g., src/services/, src/models/)
2. **Cache invalidation risk** — Per-project cache persists across service restarts; if target project's package.json changes during runtime, stale cache returns old dependencies
3. **Performance impact unknown** — New code scans directories recursively with `fs.readdirSync({ recursive: true })`; may be slow for large projects (>1000 files in lib/)
4. **Ad-hoc API usage untested** — `/api/proposer-enhanced` endpoint can be called without work_order_id; falls back to orchestrator's cwd (legacy behavior) but wasn't tested
5. **Orchestrator still running in background** — Shell 684729 active; may need restart after validation to clear state
