# Session v101 Handover — Phase 2 Foundation Complete

**Session Date:** 2025-10-17 19:30
**Previous Session:** v100 (2025-10-17 18:00)
**Type:** Implementation — Phase 2 Supervised Learning System (Foundation)

---

## Result

⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** — Phase 2 foundation complete (DB schema, scoring rubrics, dependency fix), but scripts and validation pending

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v100)

1. **Fixed TS2307 import errors systematically** — Added dependency context to proposer prompts (src/lib/enhanced-proposer-service.ts:118-187); includes package.json dependencies, project modules, and import rules; reduces proposer hallucination of non-existent packages
2. **Created Phase 2 database schema** — Applied migration to Supabase (test_iterations table with 5-dimension scores, moose_improvements table with impact tracking); includes helper views and RLS policies
3. **Implemented 5-dimension scoring rubrics** — Created src/lib/iteration-scorer.ts (389 lines) with Architecture (25%), Readability (20%), Completeness (25%), Test Coverage (15%), UX (15%); each dimension has specific criteria for tiers 1-10
4. **Performed full system reset** — Closed 5 PRs (#132-136), deleted 5 remote feature branches, reset 57 WOs to pending; multi-llm-discussion-v1 repo clean and on main
5. **Test validation blocked** — Approved 3 WOs to test dependency fix (input validation, error handling, TS strict mode), but orchestrator was stopped before execution; no validation of TS2307 fix yet

---

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (immediate):** Validate dependency context fix
   - Start orchestrator: `npm run orchestrator`
   - Approve 3-5 real WOs (use existing pending WOs)
   - Monitor execution for TS2307 errors (expect <30% vs v99's 100%)
   - Document results in evidence/v101/dependency-fix-validation.md

2. **PRIORITY 2 (4-6 hours):** Implement Phase 2 scripts
   - Create scripts/cleanup-iteration.ts (database, GitHub, filesystem cleanup)
   - Create scripts/run-iteration.ts (full cycle: init → decompose → execute → test)
   - Create scripts/score-iteration.ts (wrapper for iteration-scorer.ts with Claude Code integration)
   - Create scripts/analyze-iteration.ts (pattern detection, root cause analysis)
   - Create scripts/generate-proposals.ts (convert root causes to actionable improvements)
   - Create scripts/supervised-loop.ts (main orchestrator with human approval gate)

3. **PRIORITY 3 (1-2 days):** Test supervised loop end-to-end
   - Run 1 iteration manually to validate each script
   - Fix any issues discovered
   - Run supervised loop for 3 iterations to validate quality improvement tracking

4. **PRIORITY 4 (2-3 hours):** Update SOURCE_OF_TRUTH documentation
   - Add Section 2.5: Worktree Pool Architecture (523 lines, 15-concurrent execution)
   - Update component status table with WorktreePoolManager, WorktreeHealthMonitor
   - Update execution flow diagram with worktree lease/release

---

## Watchpoints

1. **Dependency context not validated** — 3 WOs approved but orchestrator wasn't running; must verify fix actually reduces TS2307 errors before claiming success
2. **Scoring rubrics untested** — iteration-scorer.ts implemented but never run against real code; may need calibration for consistency
3. **Phase 2 scripts are complex** — 6 scripts with database, GitHub, and filesystem interactions; high risk of bugs; test incrementally
4. **Database schema applied outside migration system** — Tables created directly in Supabase UI; verify test_iterations and moose_improvements exist with correct columns
5. **Context usage at 52%** — Still manageable but Phase 2 scripts will add more; consider archiving old evidence or using external docs
