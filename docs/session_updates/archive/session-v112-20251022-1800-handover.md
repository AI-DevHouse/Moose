# Session v112 Handover — WO Scope Validation: Analysis Complete, Implementation Plan Ready

**Session Date:** 2025-10-22
**Previous Session:** v111 (2025-10-21 16:00)
**Type:** Strategic Analysis & Implementation Planning

---

## Result

✅ **SUCCESS** — Comprehensive analysis of WO Scope Validation proposal complete, detailed implementation plan created with token budgets and logical breakpoints, ready for V113 execution start

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v111)

1. **WO Scope Validation analysis completed** — Evaluated Strategy C proposal against production data; confirmed problem exists (87.8% of 49 WOs oversized using proposed formula); validated strong inverse correlation (r=-0.97) between complexity and acceptance scores; reviewed v110/v111 execution data showing test generation failure (0/10) identical across gpt-4o-mini and Claude on same WO
2. **Comprehensive analysis document created** — 19K-word document with problem validation, formula validation against known WOs, integration analysis, ROI calculations ($0.085 cost, $0.25+ savings), risk assessment, phased deployment strategy; evidence: `docs/WO_Scope_Validation_Analysis_And_Recommendations.md`
3. **Implementation plan created with token budgets** — Detailed session-by-session plan (V112-V116) with task-level breakdowns, time/token estimates, logical handover points, emergency procedures, progress tracking; each session designed to fit 50-65k token budgets with safe exit points; evidence: `docs/WO_Scope_Validation_Implementation_Plan.md`
4. **Recommendation confirmed: Combined strategy** — Strategy C (Scope Validation) addresses primary root cause (oversized WOs, -20 to -30 pts) but insufficient alone; must combine with Tier 3 Validator (addresses test generation failure, +10 pts); expected total improvement: mid-complexity 58→85/100 (+27 pts), high-complexity 44→80/100 (+36 pts)
5. **Q1-Q4 answered with implementation details** — Shadow mode data collection plan (complexity distribution, formula accuracy, correlation analysis, 1-week collection period); schema validation strategy per §5.1 (read 7 files before implementation, validation script, dependency patterns); gpt-4o-mini testing approach (all WO execution, Claude remains architect); single-batch test plan (5 WOs, $10 budget, success criteria: r<-0.80, >75% accuracy)
6. **Analysis scripts created** — `scripts/analyze-wo-scope-validation.ts` (revealed 87.8% problematic rate from 49 WOs), `scripts/analyze-completed-wos-correlation.ts` (designed for quality correlation), `scripts/check-wo-statuses.ts` (verified all WOs pending, no execution data yet)

## Next Actions

1. **READ Implementation Plan (Priority - Session Start):** Load and read `docs/WO_Scope_Validation_Implementation_Plan.md` (25K words) — contains detailed V113 task list, token budgets, integration points, success criteria; skip to "Session V113" section after overview
2. **V113 Phase Focus: Phase 1 Complete + Phase 2a Start** (6 hours, 60k tokens target) — Execute 5 test WOs with gpt-4o-mini to validate complexity formula, implement database logging (complexity_scan_logs table), integrate scanner into architect-service.ts (shadow mode, line 115), deploy to production for 1-week data collection, START Tier 3 Validator structure if time permits
3. **V113 Task 1: Execute 5 Test WOs** (1.5h) — Approve WOs from v112 scan results (1 healthy, 2 review, 2 oversized), monitor execution with gpt-4o-mini, collect acceptance scores/refinement cycles/costs, save to evidence/v113/single-batch-execution-results.json
4. **V113 Task 2: Analyze Correlation** (30min) — Run correlation analysis on 5 WOs (predicted complexity vs actual score), validate formula (target: r < -0.80, accuracy >75%), decision gate: GO if criteria met, ADJUST if weak correlation
5. **V113 Tasks 3-5: Database Integration & Deployment** (2.5h) — Create complexity_scan_logs table migration, update logComplexityScan() to save to database, integrate into architect-service.ts after line 115 (shadow mode only), deploy with WO_SCOPE_SHADOW_MODE=true, create monitoring script
6. **OPTIONAL V113 Task 6: Start Tier 3 Validator** (1h if tokens <70k) — Create completeness-validator.ts with ValidationIssue/ValidationResult types and validateCompleteness() structure (no implementation yet, just scaffolding for V114)

## Watchpoints

1. **Implementation plan is critical reference** — V113 session MUST read `WO_Scope_Validation_Implementation_Plan.md` fully before starting work; contains exact integration points (architect-service.ts:115, batched-architect-service.ts:173), schema details, reusable code locations, token management rules; attempting implementation without reading will cause errors or rework
2. **Schema validation required before Phase 1** — V113 must verify database schema matches expectations: files_in_scope is Json type (not array), acceptance_criteria is Json, metadata.dependencies structure, risk_level enum values; if mismatches found, adjust calculator code accordingly; failure to validate schema will cause runtime errors
3. **Single-batch test correlation is decision gate** — If V113 Task 2 shows r > -0.80 OR accuracy <75%, formula needs adjustment before proceeding; do not continue to full shadow mode deployment with weak correlation; if r > -0.50 AND accuracy <60%, stop and re-evaluate entire approach
4. **Token budget discipline critical** — V113 targets 60k implementation tokens (start ~20k → end ~80k); if approaching 75k mid-session, skip optional Task 6 (Tier 3 Validator start) and handover; if reaching 180k at any point, emergency stop and minimal handover per plan §Emergency Procedures
5. **Shadow mode is production deployment** — V113 Task 5 deploys scanner to production environment (WO_SCOPE_SHADOW_MODE=true); ensure logging only (no decomposition modifications), monitor for errors first 24 hours, create alert if scan failures exceed 5% of decompositions; data collection target: 10-20 decompositions over 1 week before V114 analysis
