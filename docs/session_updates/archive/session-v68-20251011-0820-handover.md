‚úÖ **Complete rollback to pre-complexity-score state with full external cleanup**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive learning system implementation for auto-calibration** (parallel work)

### Session v68 Cleanup Actions
1. Applied 3 critical fixes from v67 plan (branch conflicts, JQ syntax, database schema)
2. Cleared all orchestrator execution data (1,492 records from Supabase)
3. Reset all 49 work orders to pending state
4. Cleared complexity scores (all NULL)

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Git Branch Conflicts ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts`
**Problem:** Branch creation failed if branch already existed
**Solution:** Added branch existence check and deletion before creating new branch

```typescript
// Lines 104-129: New logic checks for existing branches
// If branch exists: switch to main, delete it, then create fresh
```

**Impact:** Eliminates "branch already exists" errors on WO retry

### Fix #2: GitHub PR Extraction (Windows JQ Error) ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/lib/orchestrator/github-integration.ts`
**Problem:** Windows PowerShell JQ syntax error in gh CLI
**Solution:** Removed `--jq` parameter, parse JSON directly in TypeScript

```typescript
// Line 242: Changed from --jq to direct JSON parsing
// Now: gh pr list --json number (no JQ)
// Then: Parse JSON array and extract number in code
```

**Impact:** Eliminates JQ errors, reliable PR number extraction

### Fix #3: Database Schema - github_events.action ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/lib/orchestrator/result-tracker.ts`
**Problem:** Code tried to write to non-existent `action` column
**Solution:** Moved action/pr_number/branch_name into `payload` JSONB

```typescript
// Lines 76-92: Fixed github_events insert
// Old: action, pr_number, branch_name as columns
// New: All moved into payload JSONB, added work_order_id
```

**Impact:** Eliminates database write errors, enables event tracking

**Commits:**
- `8f227b9` - Fix #1 and #2 (branch conflicts + JQ)
- `16c12fa` - Fix #3 (database schema)

## üéì LEARNING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION (Parallel Work)

**Note:** This major feature was implemented in a parallel Claude Code window during session v68 and committed separately.

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive auto-adjustment system for complexity scoring based on multi-dimensional implementation success. Creates feedback loop to continuously improve model routing accuracy.

### Database Schema Extensions (3 New Tables)

**1. `complexity_learning_samples` (Lines 197-239)**
- Tracks multi-dimensional outcomes for completed work orders
- **Input fields:** predicted_complexity, complexity_factors, complexity_weights, selected_model
- **Code Writing:** success, errors, failure_class
- **Tests:** success, passed, failed, execution_time_ms
- **Build:** success, time_ms, error_count
- **PR/CI:** merged, review_comments, merge_time_hours, checks_passed/failed
- **Production:** errors_24h
- **Derived:** overall_success, success_dimensions, model_performance_score, routing accuracy

**2. `complexity_weight_history` (Lines 244-266)**
- Tracks all weight adjustment events
- **Fields:** weights snapshot, adjustment_reason, triggered_by
- **Performance:** before/after metrics, actual_improvement
- **Audit:** approved_by, applied_at timestamp

**3. `proposer_threshold_history` (Lines 271-283)**
- Tracks proposer complexity threshold adjustments
- **Fields:** proposer_id, old/new threshold, adjustment_reason
- **Metrics:** performance_metrics JSONB, approved_by, applied_at

### Core Learning Services (3 Components)

**1. `src/lib/learning/outcome-aggregator.ts`**
- Aggregates outcomes across dimensions: code writing, tests, build, PR/CI
- Queries: outcome_vectors, github_events tables
- Calculates: composite success scores (weighted across dimensions)
- Returns: `MultiDimensionalOutcome` interface

**2. `src/lib/learning/learning-sample-creator.ts`**
- Creates training samples from completed work orders
- Auto-triggered: 60s after work order completion (from result-tracker.ts)
- Process: Aggregates outcomes ‚Üí Scores success ‚Üí Evaluates routing accuracy
- Stores: Learning sample with routing error magnitude

**3. `src/lib/learning/complexity-weight-adjuster.ts`**
- Implements gradient descent for weight calibration
- **Algorithm:** Pearson correlation analysis for factor-error relationships
- **Learning rate:** 0.05 (conservative)
- **Safety limits:** Max ¬±0.15 per weight, ¬±0.30 total, 0.05-0.30 bounds
- **Cooldown:** 168 hours (1 week) between adjustments
- **Validation:** Anomaly detection, sum to 1.0 normalization

### Integration Changes

**`src/lib/complexity-analyzer.ts`**
- **New:** `loadWeightsFromDB()` - Loads weights from system_config table
- **New:** `reloadWeights()` - Force reload after adjustments
- **Modified:** `analyze()` - Calls loadWeightsFromDB on first use
- **Modified:** `updateWeights()` - Marks as loaded to prevent DB override
- Dynamic weight loading enables zero-downtime adjustments

**`src/lib/orchestrator/result-tracker.ts`**
- **New:** `createLearningSample()` async function
- **Integration:** Auto-called after successful execution (60s delay)
- **Error handling:** Non-fatal, logs but doesn't block execution

### Management Scripts (5 Tools)

**1. `scripts/calibrate-complexity-weights.ts`**
- Analyzes samples and proposes/applies weight adjustments
- **Options:** `--min-samples 50`, `--lookback-days 7`, `--auto-apply`
- **Output:** Detailed recommendations with expected impact
- **Cron-ready:** For weekly automated calibration

**2. `scripts/rollback-weight-adjustment.ts`**
- Rollback capability for safety
- **Options:** `--history-id <UUID>`, `--latest`
- Reverts to previous weight configuration

**3. `scripts/list-weight-history.ts`**
- View adjustment history and performance metrics
- **Option:** `--limit 10`
- Shows: weights, reason, before/after performance

**4. `scripts/analyze-wo-distribution.ts`**
- Analyze routing patterns across proposers
- Shows: complexity distribution, model usage stats

**5. `scripts/check-proposer-thresholds.ts`**
- Validate threshold settings vs actual routing
- Identifies: threshold adjustment opportunities

### Admin API Endpoint

**`src/app/api/admin/complexity-learning-metrics/route.ts`**
- **GET** `/api/admin/complexity-learning-metrics`
- Returns: Comprehensive learning system metrics
- **Metrics:**
  - Routing accuracy rates
  - Model usage distribution
  - Factor-outcome correlations
  - Weekly trends and performance
  - Success rates by dimension

- ‚úÖ Min/max weight bounds (0.05 - 0.30)
- ‚úÖ Minimum sample requirements (50 samples)
- ‚úÖ Rollback capability to previous weights
- ‚úÖ Anomaly detection and validation

**Dynamic Weight Loading:**

## üí° CRITICAL LEARNINGS

### Database Schema Mismatches
**Issue:** Code assumed `github_events` had `action`, `pr_number`, `branch_name` columns
**Reality:** Only has `event_type`, `status`, `work_order_id`, `payload`
**Lesson:** ALWAYS read schema file before database writes

### Windows PowerShell + JQ Incompatibility
**Issue:** `gh CLI --jq` syntax fails on Windows
**Solution:** Parse JSON in code instead of using JQ
**Lesson:** Avoid complex shell piping on Windows, use TypeScript

### Branch Cleanup Strategy
**Issue:** Orphaned branches cause conflicts on retry
**Solution:** Check and delete before creation
**Lesson:** Always assume branches may exist from previous runs
