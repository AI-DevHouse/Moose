**Result:** ⚠️ TACTICAL FIXES APPLIED - ARCHITECTURAL REDESIGN REQUIRED

**Δ Summary:**
- Fixed worktree pool initialization failure: Added `git worktree prune` to clean stale metadata before pool creation (worktree-pool.ts:121-133)
- Applied tactical patches for greenfield projects: Skip npm install during pool init if no package.json, run npm install during cleanup if package.json appears (worktree-pool.ts:266-276, 523-552) - **TECHNICAL DEBT**
- Approved bootstrap WO (`14b6ea23`) via script to unblock execution
- **Critical session learning:** User identified pattern of making short-term test-passing fixes instead of proper architectural solutions - must correct this approach going forward
- Conducted root cause analysis: Bootstrap creates package.json but worktree pool needs it to initialize - chicken-and-egg problem reveals architectural flaw
- **Architectural decision:** Bootstrap should NOT be WO-0, should execute BEFORE WO creation as separate infrastructure setup step
- Created comprehensive 7-phase sequential bootstrap implementation plan
- **Gap identified:** Quality validation for bootstrap output not specified in plan (prompt generation and validation architecture undefined)
- Created detailed quality validation analysis documenting 3 prompt generation options, 3 validator architecture options, 8 critical architectural decisions needed

**Next Actions:**
1. **Review bootstrap quality validation analysis** (HIGH): Read `evidence\v127\bootstrap-quality-validation-analysis.md` and make architectural decisions on 8 open questions (prompt generation strategy, validator architecture, validation timing, auto-fix policy, error reporting, rollback strategy, retry mechanism, partial success handling)
2. **Decide on validation approach** (HIGH): Choose between creating new bootstrap-validator.ts vs extending acceptance-validator vs inline validation, choose between shared prompt generator vs extracted vs duplicated
3. **Review sequential bootstrap implementation plan** (MEDIUM): Read `evidence\v127\sequential-bootstrap-implementation-plan.md` and confirm 7-phase approach is correct
4. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** (MEDIUM): After decisions made, create bootstrap-prompt-generator.ts and bootstrap-validator.ts as foundation
5. **Test multi-llm-discussion-v1 with current tactical fixes** (LOW): Verify orchestrator can start and bootstrap WO can execute with current patches before removing them

**Watchpoints:**
- Current tactical patches in worktree-pool.ts (lines 266-276, 523-552) are TECHNICAL DEBT and must be removed after proper sequential bootstrap implementation
- 8 architectural decisions required before implementation can begin - see quality validation analysis document for details
- Bootstrap execution will be synchronous and block decompose API response - need timeout handling and progress feedback
- Must handle failure scenarios: validation failure requires git rollback, partial bootstrap (has package.json but not tsconfig), concurrent decomposition attempts
- Orchestrator must fail fast with clear error if started on greenfield project after redesign - add pre-flight validation
- Sequential bootstrap fundamentally changes system assumptions: "infrastructure precedes WOs" vs "everything is a WO" - impacts dependency resolver, orchestrator logic, acceptance validation
