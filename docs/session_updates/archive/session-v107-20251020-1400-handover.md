# Session v107 Handover — Worktree Pool Optimization Validated, Quality Issues Confirmed

**Session Date:** 2025-10-20 14:00
**Previous Session:** v106 (2025-10-20 11:00)
**Type:** Worktree Pool Optimization + Extended Validation

---

## Result

✅ **SUCCESS** — Worktree pool optimization validated at scale (26× faster, 15-concurrent stable); quality issues confirmed (3.02/10 avg score, 0% pass rate)

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v106)

1. **Worktree pool optimized for production** — Modified src/lib/orchestrator/worktree-pool.ts:169-203 to copy node_modules from wt-1 to wt-2-15 using robocopy (Windows) / cp (Unix); reduced init time from ~25min to 57s for 5 worktrees (~26× faster); fixed worktree-health-monitor.ts Map iteration for TS compatibility
2. **Configuration updated to 15 worktrees** — Changed .env.local: WORKTREE_POOL_SIZE=15, ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS=15; updated SOURCE_OF_TRUTH §5.5 with full worktree architecture documentation (init process, lease/release workflow, benefits)
3. **Extended validation run completed** — Approved 57 WOs (changed status field to 'approved', not just metadata); executed 15 concurrent WOs with full worktree pool utilization; 20 WOs completed Aider execution + PR creation with 0 extraction errors
4. **Quality crisis confirmed** — Acceptance validation on 20 WOs: avg score 3.02/10 (target >6/10), 0% pass rate, 100% build failures; dimension scores: Architecture 5.0/10, Readability 8.25/10, Completeness 2.0/10, Test Coverage 0.0/10, Build Success 0.0/10; validates v106 finding that infrastructure works but code quality is production-blocking
5. **Full system reset executed** — Enhanced scripts/full-system-reset.ts with worktree cleanup (lines 236-274); closed 30 PRs, deleted 30 remote branches, removed all 15 worktrees, reset 57 WOs to pending status; system returned to clean state for future testing

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (DECISION REQUIRED):** Determine production readiness strategy
   - Infrastructure validated: 15-concurrent execution, 26× faster init, 0 extraction errors
   - Quality blocker: 0% acceptance pass rate, all builds fail, code incomplete
   - Options: (a) Prioritize Phase 2 supervised learning to improve proposer quality, (b) Deploy infrastructure with manual code review gates, (c) Reduce scope to simpler tasks
   - Recommendation: Phase 2 is critical gap per PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_20251017.md

2. **PRIORITY 2 (if Phase 2):** Implement supervised learning scripts
   - scripts/cleanup-iteration.ts (database, GitHub, filesystem cleanup)
   - scripts/run-iteration.ts (full cycle: init → execute → test → score)
   - scripts/score-iteration.ts (wrapper for iteration-scorer.ts)
   - scripts/supervised-loop.ts (main orchestrator with human approval between iterations)
   - Target: Iteratively improve proposer prompts/rules to achieve >6/10 avg acceptance score

3. **PRIORITY 3 (if infrastructure deployment):** Scale testing
   - Test 15-worktree pool initialization time (projected: ~2-3 min vs current 57s for 5)
   - Validate sustained 15-concurrent execution over 50+ WOs
   - Monitor worktree pool health metrics during extended runs
   - Document performance characteristics for production capacity planning

4. **PRIORITY 4 (deferred):** Create v107 handover session evidence
   - Save validation test results to evidence/v107/
   - Archive session-v104 and older to archive/
   - Update SESSION_START_QUICK.md to reference v107

## Watchpoints

1. **Worktree optimization tested at 5, not 15** — Initialization time (57s) validated with 5 worktrees; 15 worktrees projected to take ~2-3 min (still 25× faster than pre-optimization); full 15-worktree init should be tested before claiming production validation
2. **Code quality is systemically poor** — 20/20 WOs failed acceptance (3.02/10 avg); all builds broken; completeness score 2.0/10 suggests proposers generate skeletal implementations; Phase 2 supervised learning is not optional for production use
3. **Extraction fix working perfectly** — 0 validation errors across 20 WOs; extraction validator (extractFromMarkdownFence + autoCleanExtraction) confirmed production-ready; no further extraction work needed
4. **Configuration updated to 15 but not stress-tested** — .env.local now set to 15 worktrees/concurrent; validated 15-concurrent execution with existing pool, but fresh initialization time for 15 worktrees not measured
5. **5 local feature branches remain** — Full system reset left 5 local branches in target repo (warning in Step 6 verification); non-blocking but should be manually cleaned: `git branch | grep feature/wo- | xargs git branch -D`
