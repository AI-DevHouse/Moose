# SESSION V89 — HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v89-20251016-1830-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-16 18:30
**Result:** ✅ Success – Phase 1 & 2 complete, worktree pool fully integrated and tested
**Version:** v89-final

---

## 1. Δ SUMMARY (Since v88)

- **✅ Phase 1 Complete** – Implemented `WorktreePoolManager` class (worktree-pool.ts) with singleton pattern, initialization, lease/release, cleanup, and stale worktree detection
- **✅ Worktree Types Added** – Created `WorktreeHandle` and `WorktreePoolStatus` interfaces in types.ts:76-90
- **✅ Core Manager Tested** – Test script validated pool initialization (3 worktrees in 38s), lease/release cycle (2.6s cleanup), blocking queue, and full cleanup (8.5s)
- **✅ Phase 2 Complete** – Integrated worktree pool with orchestrator-service (startup/shutdown/lease-release), aider-executor (worktreePath parameter), and github-integration (worktreePath parameter)
- **✅ Environment Config Added** – Added `WORKTREE_POOL_ENABLED`, `WORKTREE_POOL_SIZE`, `WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP`, `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS` to .env.local
- **✅ Build Verified** – TypeScript compilation successful, all integration points connected, backward compatible (falls back to shared directory if pool disabled)

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V90)

1️⃣ **Test with Real Work Orders** – Create 3 test WOs targeting multi-llm-discussion-v1, run orchestrator, verify worktree pool lease/release cycle works end-to-end

2️⃣ **Monitor for Race Conditions** – Check logs for branch contamination, file conflicts, or commits landing on wrong branches (should be zero with worktree isolation)

3️⃣ **Verify Acceptance Validation** – Confirm acceptance validator runs correctly in worktree paths (build/test/lint all execute in isolated directories)

4️⃣ **Check Pool Performance** – Measure total execution time for 3 concurrent WOs, verify cleanup time <10s per worktree, monitor disk usage

5️⃣ **Scale Up (If Successful)** – Increase `WORKTREE_POOL_SIZE` to 10-15, test with 20-30 WOs, verify queue blocking behavior under load

6️⃣ **Production Readiness** – If all tests pass, update documentation, set `WORKTREE_POOL_SIZE=15` for baseline collection, prepare for 500 WO run

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- ⚠️ **First Real WO Execution** – This is the first time worktree pool will execute with real Aider + PR creation flow. Monitor logs carefully for unexpected failures (branching, npm, git detection).
- ⚠️ **npm install Failures** – If npm install fails during pool initialization or in a worktree, implement retry logic or mark worktree unavailable (current: initialization fails completely).
- ⚠️ **Disk Space** – 3 worktrees = ~350MB (115MB × 3 for node_modules). Full 15-worktree pool = 1.7GB. Check available space before scaling.
- ⚠️ **Detached HEAD State** – Worktrees created with `--detach` flag. Aider's feature branch creation should work correctly, but verify first WO doesn't fail on git state.
- ⚠️ **Acceptance Validation Path** – Validator now receives worktree path instead of project.local_path. Verify build/test/lint commands execute correctly in worktree context.
