# SESSION V98 ‚Äî HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v98-20251017-1215-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-17 12:15
**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED ‚Äì Extraction validation ready but test execution blocked by poller query issue
**Version:** v98-extraction-test-blocked

---

## 1. Œî SUMMARY (Since v97)

- **‚ö†Ô∏è 5-WO Extraction Test Attempted** ‚Äì Created 5 test WOs with varying complexity (0.6-0.9), approved with metadata.auto_approved=true
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Orchestrator Running But Not Executing** ‚Äì Poller finds "0 approved Work Orders out of 50 pending" despite WOs having correct status='pending' + auto_approved=true
- **‚úÖ Worktree Pool Initialized** ‚Äì 15/15 worktrees created successfully, health monitoring active
- **‚ùå Test WOs Previously Failed Immediately** ‚Äì Initial test batch marked failed on creation with no execution logs; reset and recreated
- **üîÑ Full System Reset Executed** ‚Äì 57 WOs reset to pending, 16 PRs closed, 16 remote branches deleted, target repo cleaned to main

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V99)

**Critical Path: Debug WO Poller Query Issue**

1. **Debug poller query logic** ‚Äì Investigate why `work-order-poller.ts` finds 0 approved WOs when database shows 5 WOs with status='pending' + metadata.auto_approved=true
2. **Verify metadata structure** ‚Äì Check if metadata column type (JSONB) requires specific query syntax in Supabase client
3. **Test query directly** ‚Äì Run Supabase query matching poller logic to isolate if issue is query syntax or data structure
4. **Fix and restart test** ‚Äì Once poller issue resolved, restart orchestrator to run 5-WO extraction validation test
5. **Monitor extraction validation** ‚Äì Watch for `[ExtractionValidator]` log lines showing validation activity and auto-cleanup
6. **Measure impact** ‚Äì Compare to v96 baseline (13/15 = 87% success), target 93-100% with reduced "Line 1" TS errors

---

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- **Poller Query Bug Active** ‚Äì Orchestrator polls every 10s but finds 0 approved WOs despite correct database state
- **Background Orchestrator Still Running** ‚Äì Shell 672642 active, consuming resources but not processing WOs
- **Extraction Validation Untested** ‚Äì All v97 validation code integrated but never executed in production workflow
- **System Clean After Full Reset** ‚Äì 50 pending WOs, 0 PRs, 0 branches, clean main branch in target repo
- **Root Cause Unknown** ‚Äì Same issue occurred in v97 (test WOs immediately failed) - may indicate database trigger or schema issue

---

## 4. FILES MODIFIED (V98)

**Created:**
- `scripts/create-extraction-test-wos.ts` ‚Äì Script to create 5 test WOs
- `scripts/approve-extraction-test-wos.ts` ‚Äì Script to approve extraction test batch
- `scripts/reset-extraction-test.ts` ‚Äì Script to delete extraction test WOs
- `scripts/check-extraction-test-status.ts` ‚Äì Script to check WO status
- `scripts/check-wo-failure-details.ts` ‚Äì Script to inspect failure metadata

**No changes to core code** ‚Äì All extraction validation from v97 remains in place

**System State:**
- Database: 50 pending WOs (after full-system-reset.ts)
- GitHub: 0 open PRs, 0 remote feature branches
- Target repo: Clean on main, no local branches
- Orchestrator: Running but idle (0/0 executed/failed)
