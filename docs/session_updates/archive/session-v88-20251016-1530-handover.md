# SESSION V88 — HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v88-20251016-1530-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-16 15:30
**Result:** ⚠️ Partial Success – Branching bug fixed, but deeper race condition discovered requiring worktree pool architecture
**Version:** v88-final

---

## 1. Δ SUMMARY (Since v87)

- **✅ Critical Branching Bug Fixed** – Modified `aider-executor.ts:131-144` to always checkout main before creating feature branches, preventing cascading contamination
- **✅ Rollback Function Fixed** – Updated `github-integration.ts:284-317` and `orchestrator-service.ts:286-293` to accept and use `workingDirectory` parameter
- **✅ Cleanup Complete** – Deleted 8 contaminated branches (local + remote), reset 8 WOs to pending status, verified target repo clean
- **✅ Fix Verified Working** – Re-executed orchestrator, confirmed WO a14242af correctly checked out main despite being on WO 0170420d's branch
- **⚠️ Second Race Condition Discovered** – WO 0170420d's commits landed on WO a14242af's branch due to concurrent Aider executions in shared directory
- **✅ Root Cause Analysis Complete** – Identified shared mutable state (file-level conflicts) as structural problem, not solvable by branch checking
- **✅ Worktree Pool Architecture Designed** – Created comprehensive implementation plan for Option A (full isolation, 15 worktrees, 1.7GB disk, 8 hours faster for 500 WOs)

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V89)

1️⃣ **Implement Phase 1: Core WorktreePoolManager** – Create `src/lib/orchestrator/worktree-pool.ts` with initialization, lease/release, and cleanup logic (see implementation plan §Phase 1)

2️⃣ **Add Worktree Types** – Update `src/lib/orchestrator/types.ts` with `WorktreeHandle` and `WorktreePoolStatus` interfaces

3️⃣ **Implement Pool Initialization** – Initialize 15 worktrees on orchestrator startup, run `npm install` in each, verify all healthy

4️⃣ **Test Core Manager** – Unit tests for lease/release cycle, blocking queue behavior, cleanup logic (target: <10s cleanup per worktree)

5️⃣ **Implement Phase 2: Integration** – Modify orchestrator-service, aider-executor, github-integration to use worktree paths (see implementation plan §Phase 2)

6️⃣ **Test with Small Pool** – Start with `WORKTREE_POOL_SIZE=3`, run 10 WOs, verify no race conditions

7️⃣ **Scale to Full Pool** – Increase to 15 worktrees, run 50 WOs, measure performance vs baseline

8️⃣ **Run 500 WO Baseline** – Execute full baseline collection with worktree pool, monitor for race conditions, measure acceptance validation scores

---

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- ⚠️ **DO NOT RUN ORCHESTRATOR WITHOUT WORKTREE POOL** – Concurrent execution in shared directory will cause file-level race conditions (commits on wrong branches, build conflicts)
- ⚠️ **Disk Space Requirement** – Need 1.7GB free for 15 worktrees (115MB × 15 for node_modules/). Check before initializing pool.
- ⚠️ **npm install Failures** – If npm install fails in a worktree during initialization, implement retry logic or mark worktree as unavailable
- ⚠️ **Git Detection Retry Still Present** – Aider retry mechanism (lines 225-283 in aider-executor.ts) may need adjustment for worktree context, monitor "Git repo: none" warnings
- ⚠️ **Feature Flag Rollout** – Use `WORKTREE_POOL_ENABLED=false` initially, test with small pool before enabling for full 500 WOs
