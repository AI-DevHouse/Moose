**Result:** ✅ Architect self-correction system operational with Anthropic API integration

**Δ Summary:**
- Refactored architect-package-validator.ts to use Anthropic SDK instead of OpenRouter (eliminates third-party dependency)
- Updated decompose route to fetch provider/model from proposer_configs table (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- Verified proposer_configs has active Anthropic Claude 4.5 entry in database
- Tested validation on 49 existing multi-llm-discussion-v1 WOs: 100% success rate (49/49 corrected, 0 failures)
- Execution time: ~12 minutes for full correction workflow on 49 WOs
- All corrections tracked with architect_correction metadata including invalid packages and timestamps

**Correction Quality Sample:**
- TypeScript 5.3.0 → 5.2.2 (non-existent version fixed across all WOs)
- Removed `jest-coverage-threshold` invalid package, added config to `jest.config.js` instead  
- Fixed malformed package specifiers: `package/version@latest` → `package@version`
- Removed deprecated @types packages (@types/electron now built into electron package)
- Added missing environment variables and config files to technical_requirements

**Next Actions:**
1. (OPTIONAL) Run orchestrator on corrected WOs to verify technical_requirements execute successfully
2. Monitor architect correction latency at scale (currently ~15s per WO, acceptable for post-decomposition)
3. Consider retry logic if architect fails to correct after 1 attempt (currently blocks WO)
4. Update SESSION_START_QUICK.md reference to v135
5. Clean up test scripts with dotenv imports for future sessions

**Watchpoints:**
- Architect correction adds 2-5s per problematic WO (49 WOs = 12min total) - scales linearly
- Pre-proposer validation in orchestrator-service.ts:278 now redundant - architect handles at decompose time
- All corrections use Claude Sonnet 4.5 from proposer_configs - no hardcoded models remain
- Correction metadata stored in work_orders.metadata.architect_correction for audit trail

**Version:** v135
**Status:** Handover Complete  
**Next:** v136 - (Optional) Orchestrator execution test on corrected WOs
