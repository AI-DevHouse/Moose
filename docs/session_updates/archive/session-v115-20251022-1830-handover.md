**Result:** ⚠️ PIVOT REQUIRED

**Δ Summary:**
- Fixed orchestrator port configuration bug (3001→3000 in manager-coordinator.ts, proposer-executor.ts); all 5 test WOs executed cleanly with PRs created
- Correlation analysis failed decision gate: r=+0.962 (positive, not negative -0.80 target); discovered acceptance scoring changed from historical /100 to current /10 scale
- Dimensional analysis revealed root cause: 100% build failures + 0% test coverage creates broken baseline; only readability dimension varies (15% weight), masking true relationship
- Compared historical WOs: all rescored 27-33/100 (vs historical 44-78/100); validation test compromised by broken project baseline
- Pivoted strategy: abandon formula validation, focus on root cause analysis of build failures and dimensional improvement tracking
- Documented pragmatic approach: analyze build error patterns, create static test suite, track dimensional scores (not complexity correlation)

**Next Actions:**
1. Analyze build failures: inspect 5 test WO PRs (246-250), categorize error patterns (imports, types, config), identify proposer fix requirements
2. Design static test suite: choose approach (synthetic test cases OR reusable WO set), define 5-10 baseline test cases, document expected vs actual metrics
3. Define dimensional targets: Build 0%→70%, Tests 0%→30%, Completeness 2.0→7.0, Overall 2.9→6.5; establish measurement protocol
4. Fix proposer based on error patterns OR test on working project baseline (e.g., moose-mission-control itself with passing builds)
5. Implement database logging for complexity scans (deferred from v114 Task 3) if time permits

**Watchpoints:**
- Correlation validation approach is fundamentally flawed with broken project baseline; do NOT retry validation until builds pass
- Historical r=-0.97 claim was from different scoring method; current acceptance validator uses 0-10 scale with 5 dimensions
- All 49 multi-llm-discussion-v1 WOs have broken baseline (builds fail); may need different project for clean validation
- Dimensional approach is more actionable: measures WHAT fails (builds, tests) not WHETHER formula predicts it
- Token budget: v115 used 121k (60% usage); v116 should focus on build analysis (estimated 40-50k for PR reviews + documentation)
