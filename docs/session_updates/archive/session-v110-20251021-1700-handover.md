# Session v110 Handover — Tier 1 Prompt Testing & Rapid Reset Implementation

**Session Date:** 2025-10-21 17:00
**Previous Session:** v109 (2025-10-21 17:00)
**Type:** Tier 1 Prompt Evaluation & Testing Workflow Optimization

---

## Result

✅ **SUCCESS** — Tier 1 prompt improvements validated on low complexity (+34pts to 78/100), rapid reset workflow implemented (8-14min savings/iteration), root cause identified (gpt-4o-mini capability ceiling not prompt design)

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v109)

1. **Tier 1 prompt restructuring implemented** — Unified `buildPromptForProvider()` with sandwich structure (critical rules top+bottom), provider-specific optimization (CONCISE_CODE_RULES for GPT-4o-mini, DETAILED for Claude), token budgeting (6K OpenAI, 12K Claude), numbered requirements extraction, dependency context truncation (max 30% of budget); file: `src/lib/enhanced-proposer-service.ts` lines 106-1084
2. **Rapid reset script created** — `scripts/rapid-reset.ts` clears PRs and branches only, preserves worktrees and node_modules for 8-14min savings per test iteration; complements `full-system-reset.ts` for quick A/B testing
3. **Worktree reuse logic implemented** — Modified `src/lib/orchestrator/worktree-pool.ts` to check if worktrees exist, clean them (reset to main, delete branches), and reuse node_modules instead of deleting/recreating; controlled by `WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=false` in `.env.local`; saves ~5-10 minutes on orchestrator startup
4. **Tier 1 tested on 3 complexity levels** — Low (0.41): 78/100 (+34pts, ZERO placeholders, excellent), Mid (0.55): 58/100 (+14pts, some issues), High (0.98): 44/100 (-21pts regression); **correlation confirmed**: prompt quality inversely proportional to complexity
5. **Root cause identified** — Tier 1 prompts work perfectly at low complexity but hit gpt-4o-mini capability ceiling at mid/high; problem is model capacity not prompt design; routing bug discovered (calls gpt-4o-mini "highest capability" when it's lowest)
6. **Evidence documentation created** — 2 comprehensive files in `evidence/v110/`: (1) Tier 1 acceptance evaluation with high complexity scoring (44/100), (2) Low/mid complexity evaluation comparing all 3 complexity levels with statistical analysis proving model capability ceiling hypothesis

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (Immediate — v111):** Review acceptance scoring patterns and extract prompt improvement principles
   - Analyze what worked in low complexity (78/100): ZERO placeholders, excellent error handling, complete tests
   - Analyze what failed in mid/high complexity: missing files, no tests, placeholder reducers, broken imports
   - Extract generalizable patterns: specific failure modes that prompts could address
   - Document principles in evidence/v111/ before next prompt iteration
   - Goal: Identify if any prompt refinements can push mid complexity (0.55) from 58→75/100

2. **PRIORITY 2 (v111):** Decide next strategy path based on principle analysis
   - Option A: If principles suggest prompt improvements can help mid complexity → Implement targeted prompt refinements (2-3 hours)
   - Option B: If principles show diminishing returns → Implement Tier 3 programmatic validator (10 hours, highest ROI)
   - Option C: If routing is confirmed as blocker → Fix routing to use Claude for mid/high complexity (2 hours)
   - Decision criteria: Can we realistically get mid complexity (0.55) above 75/100 with gpt-4o-mini, or is it a lost cause?

3. **PRIORITY 3 (v111 if Option A chosen):** Implement targeted prompt improvements
   - Based on extracted principles from Priority 1
   - Focus on mid complexity pain points: missing file detection, test generation enforcement, import validation
   - Test on same WO-0170420d (Redux - 0.55) to measure improvement
   - Target: 75/100 minimum (vs current 58/100)

4. **PRIORITY 4 (v111-v112 if Option B chosen):** Implement Tier 3 programmatic validator
   - Build completeness validator (`src/lib/completeness-validator.ts`): detect missing files, placeholder code, test assertion count, import validity
   - Integrate into refinement loop before syntax checking
   - Test on all 3 complexity levels to measure effectiveness
   - Expected: 85-92/100 across all complexities with deterministic enforcement

## Watchpoints

1. **Tier 1 effectiveness plateaus by complexity** — Low (0.41): 78/100 excellent; Mid (0.55): 58/100 moderate; High (0.98): 44/100 failure; pattern suggests gpt-4o-mini has fixed reasoning capacity that prompts can't overcome; may hit diminishing returns trying to improve mid/high complexity scores via prompts alone
2. **Mid complexity still has critical gaps** — PR #237 (Redux 0.55) references non-existent `./middleware/ipcMiddleware` file (broken import), has zero tests despite acceptance criterion, no error handling (2/10), uses `any` types; if prompt improvements can't fix import validation and test generation, need programmatic validation
3. **Routing bug confirmed but bypassed for testing** — Manager calls gpt-4o-mini "highest capability" when selecting proposer; currently bypassed for tests but will need fixing before production; affects cost optimization and quality; located in `src/lib/manager-routing-rules.ts` routing decision logic
4. **Rapid reset + worktree reuse working well** — Saves 8-14 minutes per iteration; `.env.local` has `WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=false`; verify this setting persists between sessions; if worktrees get deleted unexpectedly, check env file
5. **Statistical significance needed** — Only tested 1 WO per complexity level; before concluding Tier 1 effectiveness, should test 3-5 WOs at each level to confirm pattern isn't WO-specific; low sample size risk
