# SESSION V93 — HANDOVER
**Path:** C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\session-v93-20251017-0945-handover.md
**Date:** 2025-10-17 09:45
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS – Post-autocompact wrap-up + metadata mystery resolved via server log analysis
**Version:** v93-diagnostic

---

## 1. Δ SUMMARY (Since v92)

- **✅ Post-Autocompact Wrap-Up** – Token limit reached in v92, session summarized and v92 results confirmed
- **✅ V92 Achievement Validated** – Branching fix (v91) fully validated with WO 34879782 completing end-to-end (PR #107, acceptance 4.5/10)
- **✅ "Metadata Mystery" RESOLVED** – Server logs revealed WOs 54e49c81, 2c76df9f, f0fd1bf2 were already `executing` when metadata was updated; NO Supabase bug - approval flags only work on `pending` WOs
- **✅ Cleanup Procedures Established** – User emphasized "always reset before next test" - PR close, branch deletion, worktree removal validated
- **⚠️ Scale Test Status** – 3-concurrent WO test remains incomplete; needs fresh `pending` WOs for proper approval test

---

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS (FOR V94)

1️⃣ **Kill Background Orchestrators** – 3 shells still running from v92/v93 (1e6a47, da9a61, dd087b) - do this FIRST

2️⃣ **Complete 3-Concurrent WO Scale Test** – Primary objective
   - Query database for 3 truly **fresh pending WOs** with `status = 'pending'` (not `executing` or `failed`)
   - Use `scripts/approve-latest-3-wos.ts` to set `metadata: { auto_approved: true, worktree_scale_test_v94: true }`
   - Start orchestrator and monitor for concurrent execution
   - Validate: all 3 worktrees leased simultaneously, 3 different feature branches created in parallel
   - Monitor for resource contention or git locking issues
   - **Remember:** "always reset before next test" - cleanup PRs, branches, worktrees after test

3️⃣ **Fix Approval Script Metadata Overwrite Issue** – Lower priority enhancement
   - `scripts/approve-latest-3-wos.ts` line 38 overwrites entire metadata object
   - Consider creating a "merge" version that preserves existing fields like `manager_routing`
   - Only needed if approving WOs that already have metadata fields

4️⃣ **Optional: Proposer Latency Analysis** – Lowest priority
   - Step 2 (code generation) taking 60-90 seconds per WO
   - Verify OPENAI_API_KEY validity, check for rate limiting
   - Consider acceptable vs. problematic latency thresholds

## 3. WATCHPOINTS

- ✅ **V91 Branching Fix VALIDATED** – Feature branches successfully created from detached HEAD in worktrees (no git errors)
- ✅ **No Supabase Metadata Bug** – Server logs confirmed WOs 54e49c81, 2c76df9f, f0fd1bf2 were already `executing` status at 09:14-09:15; approval flags only affect `pending` WOs during poller query (work-order-poller.ts:45-50)
- ⚠️ **WO Selection Critical** – Must query for `status = 'pending'` before approval; orchestrator auto-picks pending WOs immediately on startup
- ⚠️ **Approval Script Overwrites Metadata** – `approve-latest-3-wos.ts` line 38 replaces entire metadata object; use only on fresh WOs with no existing metadata
- ✅ **Cleanup Protocol Established** – User requires full cleanup between tests: PR close, remote branch delete, local worktree removal
- ⚠️ **3 Orchestrator Processes Still Running** – Shells 1e6a47, da9a61, dd087b need to be killed before v94 starts

---

## 4. FILES MODIFIED (V92)

- **Created:** `scripts/fix-wo-metadata.ts` – Attempts to merge `auto_approved` with existing metadata (doesn't work as expected)
- **Created:** `docs/session_updates/evidence/v92/orchestrator-success.log` – Full WO 34879782 execution log
- **Created:** `docs/session_updates/session-v92-20251017-0913-handover.md` – V92 session documentation

## 6. CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM V92

### ✅ Branching Fix Validation (Step 3)
- **Worktree:** C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1-wt-1 (detached HEAD)
- **Branch:** feature/wo-34879782-update-readme-with-project-architecture-overview
- **Status:** "Feature branch created successfully" ✅
- **Commit:** 632c288 "docs: Update README and add architecture documentation overview"
- **Result:** NO GIT ERRORS - v91 fix works perfectly

### ✅ "Metadata Persistence Issue" RESOLVED (V93)
- **Original Problem (V92):** `scripts/fix-wo-metadata.ts` reported "✅ Fixed" but orchestrator showed 0 approved WOs
- **Root Cause Discovered (V93):** Server logs revealed WOs were already in `executing` status when metadata was updated
  - **54e49c81**: Executing at 09:14:45 (proposer completed with 5 TS errors)
  - **f0fd1bf2**: Executing at 09:14:55 (proposer completed with 18 TS errors)
  - **2c76df9f**: Executing at 09:15:16 (proposer completed with 4 TS errors)
- **Why Orchestrator Showed 0 Approved:** work-order-poller.ts only checks `pending` status WOs (line 45-50); `executing` WOs are filtered out
- **Conclusion:** NO Supabase bug - metadata updates likely worked, but were irrelevant for WOs already executing
- **Lesson:** Always verify WO status is `pending` before attempting approval; orchestrator picks up pending WOs immediately on startup
