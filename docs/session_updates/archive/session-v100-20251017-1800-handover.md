# Session v100 Handover — Production Readiness Assessment Complete

**Session Date:** 2025-10-17 18:00
**Previous Session:** v99 (2025-10-17 13:00)
**Type:** Assessment & Planning

---

## Result

⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** — Comprehensive assessment complete, system is 75% production ready (operational but lacks quality validation)

---

## Δ Summary (Changes Since v99)

1. **Created comprehensive production readiness report** — 87-page assessment saved to `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_20251017.md`
2. **Updated all 3 planning documents** — Added status headers to DELIVERY_PLAN, SOURCE_OF_TRUTH, TECHNICAL_PLAN with progress and gaps
3. **Identified critical blocker** — Phase 2 (Supervised Improvement System) not started; required for production quality claim
4. **Confirmed architectural enhancements operational** — Worktree Pool (523 lines), Extraction Validator (165 lines), Phase 4 acceptance validation working
5. **Analyzed v99 test failures** — All 5 WOs failed with TS2307 import errors; systematic issue in proposer code generation (references non-existent dependencies)
6. **Documented completion status** — Phase 0 (100%), Phase 1 (90%), Phase 2 (0%), Phase 3 (0%), Phase 4 (optional), Phase 5 (0%)

---

## Next Actions

1. **PRIORITY 1 (5-7 days):** Implement Phase 2 Supervised Improvement System
   - Create 6 scripts: cleanup, run-iteration, score, analyze, propose, supervised-loop
   - Implement scoring rubrics (1-10 scale, 5 dimensions)
   - Create test_iterations and moose_improvements database tables
   - Run supervised loop to 8/10 quality for 3 consecutive iterations

2. **PRIORITY 2 (1-2 days):** Fix TypeScript import error pattern
   - Add dependency inventory to proposer context (installed deps from package.json)
   - Add available modules list to proposer context
   - Should reduce TS2307 errors by 70%+

3. **PRIORITY 3 (2-3 hours):** Update SOURCE_OF_TRUTH documentation
   - Add Section 2.5: Worktree Pool Architecture
   - Update component status table with WorktreePoolManager and WorktreeHealthMonitor
   - Update execution flow diagram with worktree lease/release

4. **OPTIONAL:** Run baseline testing (20-30 WOs) to establish pre-Phase-2 metrics

---

## Watchpoints

1. **Phase 2 is critical path** — Cannot claim "production quality" without systematic validation loop; this is the difference between "working" and "proven quality"
2. **Systematic code generation issue** — 100% failure rate in v99 with TS2307 errors suggests proposer lacks dependency awareness; must fix before production
3. **Worktree pool undocumented** — Major architectural change (15-concurrent execution) exists in code but not in SOURCE_OF_TRUTH; risk for future developers
4. **Monitoring dashboard missing** — Phase 1 skipped dashboard implementation; reduces operational visibility (can query DB directly as workaround)
5. **Extraction auto-clean at 80%** — 1/5 WOs in v99 had persistent code fences after auto-clean; acceptable but monitor over next 20-30 WOs

## Key Metrics

- **Overall Progress:** 75% production ready
- **Phase Completion:** Phase 0 (100%), Phase 1 (90%), Phase 2-5 (0%)
- **Extraction Validator:** 80% clean rate (4/5 WOs in v99)
- **Worktree Pool:** 15-concurrent execution operational
- **Learning System:** Failure classification 100% operational, decision logging active
- **Critical Gap:** No quality validation loop (Phase 2)

---

## Quality Assessment

**What Works:**
- Full E2E pipeline operational (spec → PR)
- 100% failure classification with 9 failure types
- Extraction validation prevents markdown artifacts
- Worktree pool enables true concurrent execution
- Self-refinement with contract validation (max 3 cycles)

**What's Missing:**
- No objective quality measurement (1-10 rubrics)
- No proof that improvements work (supervised loop)
- TypeScript import errors in 100% of test cases
- No monitoring dashboard for failure patterns

**Bottom Line:** System is operationally solid but cannot prove code quality meets standards. Phase 2 required before production deployment.
