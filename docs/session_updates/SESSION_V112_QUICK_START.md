# Session v112 Quick Start Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-21+
**Previous Session:** v111 (Strategic Analysis & Interactive Exemplar)
**Status:** Ready to begin

---

## Current State (from v111)

### ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

**Priority 1 Analysis Complete:**
- Analyzed acceptance scoring patterns across 3 complexity levels
- Conclusion: Prompt refinements alone are insufficient (gpt-4o-mini ignoring existing rules due to capability ceiling)
- Root cause: Models drop tests under cognitive load (operational issue, not capability issue)

**Claude A/B Test Complete:**
- Mid complexity: Claude 66/100 vs gpt-4o-mini 58/100 (+8 but fails 75 target)
- Low complexity: Claude 67/100 vs gpt-4o-mini 78/100 (-11 REGRESSION)
- **Both models: 0/10 on tests** (identical failure pattern)
- Conclusion: Routing fix alone insufficient

**Interactive Exemplar Created:**
- PR #241: Redux Toolkit store implemented interactively
- Score: 94/100 (vs automated Claude 66/100)
- Key differences: Tests 0/10 ‚Üí 10/10, Docs 2/10 ‚Üí 9/10, Error handling 5/10 ‚Üí 9/10
- Proves: Same model CAN produce high quality with right constraints

**Strategic Documents Created:**
- `comprehensive-analysis-and-strategy.md` (23K words - full analysis)
- `interactive-vs-automated-case-study.md` (15K words - for LLM discussion)
- `claude-ui-strategy-prompt.md` (discussion prompt)
- Multiple evidence files with detailed evaluations

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

### PRIORITY 1: Discuss with Other LLMs (2 hours) üéØ

**Goal:** Validate or challenge analysis conclusions with alternative perspectives

**Steps:**
1. Open `evidence/v111/interactive-vs-automated-case-study.md`
2. Paste into Claude UI (fresh instance), GPT-4, or other LLM
3. Ask specific questions:
   - "Why do multiple models exhibit identical test generation failure (0/10)?"
   - "Which intervention would you prioritize: validator, templates, or routing?"
   - "What's your interpretation of the root cause?"
4. Document responses in `evidence/v112/llm-discussion-responses.md`

**Alternative:** Use `evidence/v111/claude-ui-strategy-prompt.md` for structured discussion

---

### PRIORITY 2: Fix PR Body Truncation (2 hours)

**Goal:** Enable Claude high-complexity testing

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/lib/orchestrator/github-integration.ts:237
const MAX_PR_BODY_LENGTH = 65000;
if (prBody.length > MAX_PR_BODY_LENGTH) {
  prBody = prBody.substring(0, MAX_PR_BODY_LENGTH) + '\n\n...(truncated)';
}
```

**Test:**
- Re-run WO-787c6dd1 (Clipboard Coordination, high 0.98) with Claude
- Complete A/B test comparison
- Document in `evidence/v112/claude-high-complexity-evaluation.md`

---

### PRIORITY 3: Implement Tier 3 Validator (10 hours) ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**Goal:** Achieve 75-85/100 on mid complexity through programmatic enforcement

**Implementation:**
1. Create `src/lib/completeness-validator.ts`
2. Implement 5 validation checks:
   - Test assertion count (min 3 per test)
   - Placeholder detection (comment-only methods, TODOs)
   - Import validation (files exist)
   - Error handling coverage (try-catch on risky operations)
   - Type safety scan (detect `: any\b`)
3. Integrate into `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts` BEFORE syntax checking
4. Test on 10 WOs (3 low, 4 mid, 3 high)
5. Measure: score improvement, cost impact, refinement success rate

**Expected Outcome:** 75-85/100 on mid complexity with deterministic enforcement

---

### PRIORITY 4: WO Template Improvements (4 hours)

**Goal:** Reduce cognitive load through better structure

**Implementation:**
- CRITICAL section at top (tests explicit)
- Explicit file structure (CREATE markers)
- Concrete code examples
- Test requirements as separate section
- Success checklist

**Test:** Pilot on 5 WOs (2 low, 2 mid, 1 high)

## Critical Findings Summary

### Test Generation is the Biggest Gap

**Pattern:**
- gpt-4o-mini automated: 0/10 ‚ùå
- Claude automated: 0/10 ‚ùå
- Claude interactive: 10/10 ‚úÖ

**Conclusion:** Not a capability issue - models DROP tests under cognitive load

**Solution:** Tier 3 Validator to ENFORCE test creation programmatically

---

### Routing Fix Has Limited Value

**Data:**
- Claude mid: 66/100 (+8 vs gpt-4o-mini 58/100)
- Still fails 75/100 target by -9 points
- 10x cost increase ($0.05 ‚Üí $0.50/WO)

**Conclusion:** Routing alone insufficient, validator needed regardless

---

### Interactive Mode Shows What's Possible

**Comparison:**
- Automated: 66/100
- Interactive: 94/100
- Delta: +28 points

**Key advantages:**
- Rubric visibility (knew tests = critical)
- Tool access (verified imports)
- Time to plan (45 min vs 10 min)

**Conclusion:** Not scalable for production, but validates that quality is achievable

---

## Watchpoints for v112

1. **LLM discussion may reveal alternative explanations** - Current analysis assumes cognitive load is root cause; other LLMs may propose training data bias, sequential generation artifacts, or attention allocation as alternatives; be open to revising strategy if compelling counter-evidence emerges

2. **Validator effectiveness depends on refinement success rate** - If models receive validation errors but repeat same mistakes (don't successfully address feedback), validator becomes ineffective; measure on first 10 test WOs

3. **Cost increase from validator may be non-linear** - Expected +40% cost assumes 1 additional refinement cycle; if validator triggers 3-5+ cycles, cost could increase 2-3x; monitor closely

4. **Sample size is small (n=1 per test)** - Interactive exemplar and A/B tests based on single WOs per complexity level; patterns may not generalize; consider expanding sample size before claiming certainty

---

## Quick Commands

**Check current WOs:**
```bash
powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/find-wos-by-complexity.ts
```

**Approve test WOs:**
```bash
powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/approve-ab-test-wos.ts
```

**Check execution results:**
```bash
powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-execution-results.ts
```

**Rapid reset (for testing):**
```bash
powershell.exe -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/rapid-reset.ts
```

---

## Decision Point

**Before implementing validator, consider:**

1. **Discuss with other LLMs first** (PRIORITY 1) - May reveal insights that change strategy
2. **Fix PR body truncation** (PRIORITY 2) - Quick win, unblocks Claude high-complexity testing
3. **Then decide:** Proceed with validator (PRIORITY 3) or adjust based on LLM feedback

**Recommended path:** Conservative (discuss ‚Üí fix ‚Üí validate ‚Üí implement)
