# Session v144 Handover — 2025-10-29 17:00

## Result
⚠️ Partial Success — Orchestrator fixes deployed and working; 90% WO execution in fallback mode; worktree pool failed on startup due to reused worktrees with stale node_modules

## Δ Summary (Changes since v143)

1. **Bootstrap Complete**: Merged to main (cf9cf11), pushed to GitHub; removed native blockers (robotjs, spectron, @types/electron) → commit 3960929
2. **Orchestrator Failure Analysis**: Identified 4 root causes from first run (23 failures):
   - Timeout (300s too short)
   - Unicode encoding (Windows CP1252 errors)
   - PR body length limit (65536 chars)
   - Stale branch conflicts
3. **Fixes Implemented & Committed**:
   - `aider-executor.ts`: timeout 300s→600s, PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
   - `github-integration.ts`: PR body truncation, auto-delete stale branches
4. **System Reset Process**: Created 7-step reset (3 new scripts); reset 49 WOs to clean approved state; closed 25 PRs, deleted 25 branches; removed 14 worktrees; 8/8 verification checks passed
5. **Second Orchestrator Run**: Started fresh but pool init failed (line 26: npm install failed on robotjs in wt-1); **orchestrator fell back to shared directory mode**; 44/49 WOs executed (90% success), 43 PRs created (#358-#490), 5 failures
6. **Root Cause Discovered**: Orchestrator reused worktrees from first run (`WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP` not set); old node_modules contained robotjs binaries despite package.json fix; npm rebuild failed → pool abandoned → sequential execution only

## Next Actions

1. **Before next orchestrator start**: Set `WORKTREE_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=true` in env OR run `scripts/remove-physical-worktrees.ts` to force clean slate
2. **Handle in-progress WOs**: 44 WOs still running after 3.5 hours; either wait for completion/timeout (10min × 44 = 7+ hours total) or stop orchestrator and reset
3. **Test parallel execution**: With clean worktrees, verify pool initializes successfully and 15-concurrent execution works
4. **Review PR quality**: Check `evidence/v144/pr-samples/` for code quality from successful executions
5. **Consider automation**: Add startup check for stale worktrees (>1 hour old); compare wt-1 package.json vs main before reuse

## Watchpoints

- **Worktree reuse is dangerous**: Old node_modules persist even when package.json changes; forces full reinstall or cleanup
- **Shared mode is slow but reliable**: Sequential execution (7× slower) but 90% success rate; validates core workflow even without parallelization
- **44 WOs in limbo**: Still `in_progress` after 3.5 hours; may be stuck or executing very slowly; monitor or reset
- **Pool dependency critical**: Without working pool, orchestrator throughput drops from ~30min to ~3.5 hours for 44 WOs
- **Stale worktree detection needed**: Orchestrator should detect mismatched package.json or age and auto-clean before reuse

## Scripts Modified/Added

**Created (5 investigation scripts):**
- `reset-wos-to-clean-approved.ts` — Reset 49 WOs to approved, clear execution artifacts, preserve tech reqs
- `cleanup-github-prs-and-branches.ts` — Close all PRs, delete all feature branches via gh CLI
- `verify-reset-state.ts` — 8-point verification checklist for post-reset readiness
- `fetch-mld-wos.ts` — Query multi-llm-discussion-v1 WOs with native dependency analysis
- `analyze-failure-patterns.ts`, `get-current-wo-status.ts`, etc. — Failure investigation helpers

**Modified (2 orchestrator files):**
- `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts` — Timeout 300s→600s (line 345), PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 (line 358)
- `src/lib/orchestrator/github-integration.ts` — PR body max 65000 chars (line 169), auto-delete stale branches on push conflict (line 164)

## Database State

- **Work Orders**: 44 in_progress, 5 failed, 0 approved (all picked up by orchestrator)
- **GitHub**: 43 open PRs (#358-#490), 43 feature branches, 25 closed PRs from first run
- **Multi-LLM-Discussion-v1**: Main at 23c11d7 (robotjs removed), 14 worktrees exist with stale node_modules
