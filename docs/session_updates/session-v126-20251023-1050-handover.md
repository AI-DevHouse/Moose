**Result:** ⚠️ BOOTSTRAP & DEPENDENCY FIXES DEPLOYED BUT WORKTREE POOL REQUIRES RESTART

**Δ Summary:**
- Implemented package-lock.json support in bootstrap-wo-generator.ts: Added explicit npm install requirement, package-lock.json to filesInScope and acceptance criteria
- Implemented dependency-aware branching in aider-executor.ts: Added getBaseBranchForWorkOrder() to query dependency WO's github_branch, updated createFeatureBranch() to accept baseBranch parameter and checkout dependency branch before creating feature branch
- Fixed multi-llm-discussion-v1 repository: Removed package-lock.json from .gitignore, committed lock file to main branch (commit 618022c)
- Created analyze-dependency-graph.ts: Comprehensive script for circular dependency detection, critical path analysis, and parallelism opportunities (confirmed 6-WO test has optimal 2-level structure with no cycles)
- Diagnosed worktree pool exhaustion: Bootstrap WO stuck at "Pool exhausted, queueing WO" despite proposer completing successfully
- Discovered rapid-reset.ts clears ALL metadata including dependencies: Re-added dependencies via add-bootstrap-dependency.ts, created reset-six-wos-only.ts for surgical resets

**Next Actions:**
1. **Restart orchestrator daemon** (HIGH): Worktree pool showing 0 total worktrees, needs initialization for project f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951
2. **Verify bootstrap WO execution** (HIGH): Monitor orchestrator logs for successful worktree lease, Aider execution, and PR creation with package-lock.json
3. **Fix rapid-reset.ts** (MEDIUM): Modify to preserve metadata.dependencies when clearing work_orders, prevents need for manual re-add after resets
4. **Monitor 6-WO test completion** (MEDIUM): Expect 1 bootstrap PR + 5 feature PRs, verify CI passes with package-lock.json present, confirm dependency-aware branching (features branch from bootstrap's branch)
5. **Archive old handovers** (LOW): Move session-v123, v124 to archive/ (keeping only v125, v126 active)

**Watchpoints:**
- Worktree pool MUST initialize with at least 3 worktrees before bootstrap WO can execute (currently showing 0 total)
- rapid-reset.ts clearing dependencies is a silent workflow killer - requires manual intervention every time (fix urgently or document prominently)
- Bootstrap WO scope now includes package-lock.json but proposer may not honor "You MUST run npm install" instruction - monitor first execution carefully
- Dependency-aware branching assumes single-parent chains (validated for current 6-WO star topology) - multi-parent support not yet implemented
- Orchestrator leaves WOs at "in_progress" after PR creation until merged (expected behavior per v125 findings)
