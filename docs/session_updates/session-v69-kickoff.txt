SESSION v69 KICKOFF

Read: C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\SESSION_START_QUICK.md

CRITICAL: Session v68 FAILED (75.5% failure rate). Manual cleanup was skipped.

Before doing ANYTHING:
1. Read the v68 critical error section in SESSION_START_QUICK.md (lines 9-22)
2. Read session-v68-20251011-1040-handover.md for full context

Your tasks:
1. Clean target repo (48 branches + 25 open PRs)
2. Reset 37 failed + 12 in-progress WOs to pending
3. Three-phase test approach:
   - Phase 1: 5 WOs (normal routing) - validate cleanup worked
   - Phase 2: 5 WOs (GPT-4o-mini ONLY) - compare outcomes
   - Phase 3: Remaining ~40 WOs (normal routing) - full run

IMPORTANT:
- Test phases validate system before committing to full run
- Phase 2 requires forcing all 5 WOs to GPT-4o-mini (override Manager routing)

DO NOT start orchestrator until cleanup is verified complete.

All code fixes are done. This is purely cleanup + phased test run.
