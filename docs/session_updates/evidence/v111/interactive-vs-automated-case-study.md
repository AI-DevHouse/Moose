# Case Study: Interactive vs Automated Code Generation Quality
## A Comparative Analysis of Same-Model Performance Under Different Constraints

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Authors:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Subject & Analyst), Human Operator (Court)
**Purpose:** Examine quality differences when the same LLM operates in automated vs interactive modes
**Audience:** AI systems, researchers, and engineers developing code generation systems

---

## Abstract

This case study compares code generation quality from the same language model (Claude Sonnet 4.5) under two operational modes: (1) automated one-shot generation with limited refinement, and (2) interactive generation with tool access, explicit quality criteria, and planning time.

**Key Finding:** The same model produced code scoring 66/100 in automated mode and 94/100 in interactive mode—a 28-point improvement. The largest differences were in test generation (0/10 → 10/10), documentation (2/10 → 9/10), and error handling (5/10 → 9/10).

**Central Question:** Are these differences due to fundamental model limitations, operational constraints, or something else? And can automated mode be improved to approach interactive quality?

## Experimental Setup

### Background: The Problem Domain

An AI orchestration system uses LLMs to generate code from work order specifications. Quality is measured using a 10-criterion rubric (100 points total). The system struggled to achieve production-ready quality (target: 75/100 minimum).

**Previous test results:**
- gpt-4o-mini: 58/100 on mid-complexity (fails by -17)
- Claude 4.5 (automated): 66/100 on mid-complexity (fails by -9)
- Both models: 0/10 on test generation

### The Experiment

**Hypothesis:** Can the same model (Claude 4.5) achieve significantly better quality in interactive mode?

**Work Order:** Configure Redux Toolkit Store Foundation with TypeScript
**Complexity:** 0.55 (mid-range on 0-1 scale)
**Requirements:** 6 acceptance criteria including store configuration, type exports, DevTools, HMR, and testing

### Operational Modes Compared

#### Mode 1: Automated (Baseline - PR #239)

| Aspect | Configuration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 |
| **Context** | Work order description + truncated dependency context (max 30% of token budget) |
| **Prompt** | Tier 1 optimized (sandwich structure, provider-specific rules, token budgeting) |
| **Tool Access** | None (proposer generates code in response to single prompt) |
| **Refinement** | 2 cycles (syntax error correction only) |
| **Quality Rubric** | Implicit (Priority 1 rules mentioned, full rubric not provided) |
| **Time** | ~5-10 minutes |
| **Cost** | ~$1.00 per work order |

#### Mode 2: Interactive (Experimental - PR #241)

| Aspect | Configuration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 (same model as Mode 1) |
| **Context** | Work order + full repository access via tools |
| **Prompt** | None (conversational instructions) |
| **Tool Access** | Full (Read files, verify imports, check structure, Git operations) |
| **Refinement** | Interactive planning before implementation |
| **Quality Rubric** | Explicit (10-criterion rubric visible and discussed) |
| **Time** | ~30-45 minutes |
| **Cost** | ~$5-10 equivalent in human time |

### Evaluation Criteria

Code quality assessed using 10 criteria (10 points each):

1. **No Placeholder Code** (Priority 1) - All functions fully implemented
2. **Error Handling** (Priority 1) - Try-catch on operations that can fail
3. **Input Validation** (Priority 1) - Runtime validation of inputs
4. **Context Awareness** (Priority 1) - Correct APIs for environment
5. **Resource Cleanup** (Priority 1) - No memory leaks
6. **Complete Implementation** - All acceptance criteria met
7. **Tests** - Test suite with multiple assertions per test
8. **Type Safety** - No `any` types, proper TypeScript usage
9. **Architecture & Modularity** - Clean file separation, SRP
10. **Documentation & Clarity** - JSDoc, comments, examples

| **TOTAL** | **66/100** | **94/100** | **+28** | **LARGE EFFECT** |

### Key Observations

**Stable Criteria (10/10 in both modes):**
- Context Awareness
- Type Safety
- Architecture & Modularity
- Complete Implementation (both met all 6 acceptance criteria)

**Improved Criteria (significant delta):**
- Tests: 0/10 → 10/10 (+10) ← **Largest single difference**
- Documentation: 2/10 → 9/10 (+7)
- Input Validation: 2/10 → 7/10 (+5)
- Error Handling: 5/10 → 9/10 (+4)

## Detailed Analysis

### Finding 1: Test Generation Failure is Operational, Not Capability-Based

**Evidence:**

**Automated Mode (PR #239):**
- **Result:** ZERO test files created
- **Acceptance Criterion #5:** "Store initialization tested with empty state"
- **Status:** NOT MET
- **Pattern:** Also observed in gpt-4o-mini (0/10), suggesting cross-model behavior

**Interactive Mode (PR #241):**
- **Result:** 335-line test suite created
- **Test Cases:** 16 tests across 6 describe blocks
- **Assertions:** 50+ expect() statements (3-6 per test)
- **Coverage:** All 6 acceptance criteria tested
- **Status:** FULLY MET

**Analysis:**

The model demonstrably CAN generate comprehensive tests (as shown in interactive mode). The automated mode failure suggests:

1. **Prioritization under constraint:** When cognitive load is high, tests are perceived as "optional" and dropped
2. **Acceptance criteria positioning:** Tests mentioned as criterion #5 (of 6) may be forgotten by the time code generation reaches completion
3. **No enforcement mechanism:** Without validation, there's no feedback loop to catch missing tests

**Implication:** Test generation failure is not a training gap but a resource allocation issue under operational constraints.

### Finding 2: Documentation Quality is Effort-Dependent, Not Capability-Dependent

**Evidence:**

**Automated Mode (PR #239):**
- Minimal inline comments (1-2 per file)
- No JSDoc on any exports
- One explanatory comment: `// Reducers will be added here as features are implemented`
- **Score:** 2/10

**Interactive Mode (PR #241):**
- Comprehensive JSDoc on all files (100% coverage on exports)
- Usage examples in documentation
- Inline explanatory comments on complex logic
- 73 lines of JSDoc in types.ts alone
- **Score:** 9/10

**Example comparison:**

```typescript
// Automated mode:
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>

// Interactive mode:
/**
 * RootState type derived from the store's getState method.
 * Use this type when accessing state in selectors and components.
 *
 * @example
 * const selectUser = (state: RootState) => state.user
 */
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
```

**Analysis:**

Documentation quantity scales directly with:
1. Knowledge that documentation is evaluated
2. Time available for non-functional requirements
3. Explicit requirement in task specification

**Implication:** Documentation can be improved in automated mode by making it an explicit, high-priority requirement.

### Finding 3: Error Handling Requires Intentional Design

**Evidence:**

**Automated Mode (PR #239):**
```typescript
if (isDevelopment && module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./store', () => {
    try {
      const nextRootReducer = combineReducers({})
      store.replaceReducer(nextRootReducer)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Hot module replacement failed for store:', error)
    }
  })
}
```
- HMR try-catch only
- No environment variable validation
- No error handling documentation
- **Score:** 5/10

**Interactive Mode (PR #241):**
```typescript
if (isDevelopment && typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./store', () => {
    try {
      // Recreate root reducer with updated reducers
      const nextRootReducer = combineReducers({
        // Reducers will be added here as features are implemented
      })

      // Replace the store's reducer with the updated one
      store.replaceReducer(nextRootReducer)

      console.info('[HMR] Reducers reloaded successfully')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[HMR] Hot module replacement failed for store:', error)
      // Don't crash the app - HMR failure is non-critical
      // Developer can manually refresh if needed
    }
  })
}
```
- HMR try-catch with success logging
- Environment validation: `typeof module !== 'undefined'`
- Documented error behavior: "Don't crash the app"
- Test validation of error scenarios
- **Score:** 9/10

**Analysis:**

Error handling improvements came from:
1. Planning phase: "What can fail in this code?"
2. Rubric knowledge: Error handling is Priority 1 Rule
3. Time to add comprehensive handling and documentation

**Implication:** Error handling is a design activity requiring foresight, not just syntax knowledge.

### Finding 4: Some Capabilities are Mode-Invariant

**Perfect scores in BOTH modes (10/10):**

1. **Context Awareness:** Both correctly used Redux Toolkit, Electron renderer patterns, React-Redux hooks
2. **Type Safety:** Both avoided `any` types, used proper generics, exported correct types
3. **Architecture:** Both created clean file separation (types, store, index, tests)
4. **Complete Implementation:** Both met all 6 acceptance criteria (except tests in automated)

**Analysis:**

These criteria appear to be:
- **Model training strengths:** API selection, type system usage, code organization
- **Not effort-dependent:** Don't improve with more time or planning
- **Baseline capabilities:** Present regardless of operational constraints

**Implication:** Efforts to improve automated mode should focus on variable criteria (tests, docs, error handling), not invariant ones.

## Discussion Points

### Point 1: The "Rubric Visibility" Advantage

**Observation:** Interactive mode had explicit knowledge that tests = 10% of score, documentation = 10%, etc.

**Question:** How much of the 28-point improvement is attributable to rubric visibility versus other factors?

**Thought experiment:** If automated mode received the full 10-criterion rubric in its prompt:
- Would it prioritize tests differently?
- Would token budget constraints prevent rubric inclusion?
- Would prompt bloat reduce code quality elsewhere?

**Alternative hypothesis:** Maybe rubric visibility isn't the key factor. Maybe it's just having more time/iterations that allows catching forgotten requirements.

### Point 2: The Test Generation Paradox

**Observation:** Three separate test instances:
- gpt-4o-mini automated (PR #237): 0/10 tests ❌
- Claude 4.5 automated (PR #239): 0/10 tests ❌
- Claude 4.5 interactive (PR #241): 10/10 tests ✅

**Question:** Why do multiple models, with different architectures and training, exhibit identical test generation failure in automated mode?

**Possible explanations:**

1. **Universal cognitive load pattern:** All LLMs deprioritize tests when context limit approached
2. **Training data bias:** Test code may be underrepresented in training relative to implementation code
3. **Sequential generation artifact:** Tests come "after" implementation in typical code structure, making them vulnerable to truncation/forgetting
4. **Attention allocation:** Models allocate attention to "working code" (implementation) over "validation" (tests)

**Counter-evidence:** Low complexity tests succeeded (10/10) for both models, suggesting capability exists.

**Open question:** Is there something fundamentally different about test generation that makes it harder under constraint?

### Point 3: The Scalability Problem

**Observation:** Interactive mode took 30-45 minutes. Automated took 5-10 minutes.

**Question:** Is there a middle ground that captures most of interactive's quality improvement without the time cost?

**Possibilities:**

1. **Two-pass generation:** Quick implementation pass, then dedicated test/documentation pass
2. **Checkpoint validation:** Generate code, run validator, refine if needed (current refinement approach)
3. **Scaffolding first:** Generate test stubs and file structure before implementation
4. **Explicit phase separation:** "First, write test descriptions. Then, implement code to pass tests."

**Trade-offs:** More passes = more API calls = higher cost. Is the quality improvement worth it?

### Point 4: The Context Verification Advantage

**Observation:** Interactive mode could verify imports reference real files, check file structure, read existing patterns.

**Question:** How much did context verification contribute to quality improvement?

**Evidence from scores:**
- Input Validation: 2/10 → 7/10 (+5) ← Context helped verify structure
- Complete Implementation: 10/10 → 10/10 (0) ← Both met criteria despite context difference
- No Placeholders: 9/10 → 10/10 (+1) ← Minimal impact

**Analysis:** Context verification had **moderate** impact (+5-7 points total), not primary driver.

**Implication:** Main improvements (tests +10, docs +7) came from factors other than context access.

### Point 5: Is 94/100 the Ceiling?

**Observation:** Interactive mode scored 94/100, not 100/100.

**Missing points:**
- Input Validation: 7/10 (could add runtime env checks)
- Documentation: 9/10 (could add README.md in store/)
- Resource Cleanup: 9/10 (could document lifecycle explicitly)

**Question:** Are these missing points due to:
1. **Subjective criteria:** "Perfect" documentation is impossible to define
2. **Trade-off decisions:** Runtime validation vs TypeScript reliance is a design choice
3. **Time constraints:** Even with 45 minutes, some polish remains unfinished
4. **Actual gaps:** Legitimate quality issues that could be fixed

**Philosophical question:** Should 100/100 be achievable, or should the rubric be calibrated such that 90-95/100 represents "excellent" quality?

## Questions for Other LLMs

### Strategic Questions

**Q1:** Given the data in this case study, which intervention would you prioritize:
- A) Implementing programmatic validation to enforce test creation
- B) Improving work order templates to make tests a CRITICAL requirement
- C) Switching to a two-pass generation approach (implementation then tests)
- D) Providing the full rubric in the automated prompt

**Q2:** The case study shows test generation failing identically across gpt-4o-mini and Claude 4.5 in automated mode. From your perspective, why might this be? Is it:
- Training data bias (tests underrepresented)
- Attention allocation (tests perceived as lower priority)
- Sequential generation artifact (tests come last, get dropped)
- Cognitive load universality (all models struggle similarly under constraint)
- Something else?

**Q3:** If you were designing an automated code generation system, what would you do differently based on these findings?

### Technical Questions

**Q4:** The interactive mode had explicit rubric visibility. Could this be replicated in automated mode by:
- Including the full 10-criterion rubric in the prompt?
- Using a chain-of-thought prompt asking "Will this code pass the rubric?"
- Post-generation validation pass against rubric?

What are the trade-offs of each approach?

**Q5:** Error handling improved from 5/10 to 9/10 primarily through adding try-catch blocks and documentation. Could this be automated by:
- Static analysis to detect operations that need error handling?
- Template-based error handler generation?
- Two-pass generation (implementation, then error handling pass)?

Which approach would you recommend?

**Q6:** Documentation went from 2/10 to 9/10. The interactive mode used comprehensive JSDoc. Could automated mode achieve similar documentation by:
- Post-processing to add JSDoc automatically?
- Requiring JSDoc as part of generation prompt?
- Generating documentation separately from code?

What would be most effective?

### Philosophical Questions

**Q7:** Is it ethical to claim the interactive mode as "better" when it had significant advantages (rubric visibility, tool access, time)?

**Q8:** The case study suggests quality comes from "constraints" (knowing what's checked) more than "capability." Do you agree? What implications does this have for AI safety and reliability?

**Q9:** If automated mode can only reach 75-85/100 even with validation, versus 94/100 interactive, is that acceptable for production use? What's the threshold for "good enough"?

**Q10:** The same model (Claude 4.5) produced vastly different quality under different operational conditions. What does this tell us about benchmarking LLM performance? Should benchmarks control for operational constraints?

### Predictive Questions

**Q11:** The case study proposes a "Tier 3 Programmatic Validator" to enforce test creation, placeholder detection, and import validation. Predict:
- Expected improvement in automated mode score (currently 66/100)
- Potential negative impacts (cost, time, false positives)
- Whether this addresses the root cause or just symptoms

**Q12:** If this experiment were repeated with you (the reader) as the subject:
- In automated mode, would you also score 0/10 on tests? Why or why not?
- In interactive mode, could you achieve >94/100? What would you do differently?
- Would your performance pattern match Claude 4.5's, or differ?

### Appendix B: Test Suite Sample

**From store.test.ts (335 lines total):**

```typescript
describe('Store Initialization', () => {
  it('should initialize with empty state', () => {
    const state = store.getState()

    // Verify state exists
    expect(state).toBeDefined()
    expect(state).not.toBeNull()
    expect(typeof state).toBe('object')

```

### Appendix C: Scoring Rubric Detail

**Criterion 7: Tests (10 points)**

Scoring breakdown:
- 0/10: No test files created
- 2/10: Test file exists but empty or placeholder
- 4/10: Tests exist but incomplete (<3 assertions per test)
- 6/10: Tests exist with assertions but don't cover acceptance criteria
- 8/10: Tests cover acceptance criteria but missing edge cases
- 10/10: Comprehensive tests with multiple assertions, all criteria covered, edge cases included

**Why automated mode scored 0/10:**
- No test file created at all (not even placeholder)
- Acceptance criterion explicitly required: "Store initialization tested with empty state"

**Why interactive mode scored 10/10:**
- 16 test cases across 6 suites
- 50+ assertions total (3-6 per test, exceeds minimum of 3)
- All 6 acceptance criteria tested
- Edge cases covered (HMR errors, unsubscribe, state immutability)

### Appendix D: Timeline Analysis

**Automated Mode (PR #239) - ~10 minutes:**
```
00:00 - Prompt sent with work order + context
00:02 - Code generation begins
00:05 - Initial code generated (types, store, index)
00:06 - Refinement cycle 1: Fix TypeScript errors
00:08 - Refinement cycle 2: Adjust middleware config
00:10 - Final code committed
```

**Interactive Mode (PR #241) - ~45 minutes:**
```
00:00 - Read work order requirements
00:03 - Read existing codebase patterns
00:05 - Plan file structure (types → store → index → tests)
00:10 - Implement types.ts with comprehensive JSDoc
00:20 - Implement store.ts with HMR and error handling
00:27 - Implement index.ts with typed hooks
00:42 - Implement comprehensive test suite (335 lines)
00:44 - Commit files
00:45 - Create PR with detailed description
```

**Key difference:** Test suite took 15 minutes (33% of total time) in interactive mode. In automated mode, tests weren't created at all.

### Appendix E: Cost Analysis

**Automated Mode:**
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Input tokens: ~12,000 (WO + context + prompts)
- Output tokens: ~2,000 (code generation)
- Refinement cycles: 2 × ~500 tokens
- **Total cost:** ~$1.00 per work order

**Interactive Mode:**
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Input tokens: ~20,000 (conversational + file reads)
- Output tokens: ~4,000 (code + documentation)
- Tool calls: ~10 (Read, Write, Bash)
- **Total cost:** ~$2.00 in API calls + ~$5-10 in human time equivalent (45 min at $10-15/hr)

**Cost-quality ratio:**
- Automated: $1.00 per work order / 66 points = $0.015 per quality point
- Interactive: $7.00 equivalent / 94 points = $0.074 per quality point

**Interpretation:** Interactive mode is ~5× more expensive per quality point, but achieves 42% higher absolute quality.

### Appendix F: Statistical Notes

**Sample Size Limitation:**
- n=1 for each operational mode
- Cannot determine if results generalize to other work orders
- Cannot assess variance within each mode

**Confounding Variables:**
- Different time limits may affect quality
- Tool access provides context verification advantage
- Rubric visibility may bias towards measured criteria
- Human in the loop (interactive mode) may introduce guidance

**Reproducibility:**
- Automated mode: Highly reproducible (same prompt → similar output)
- Interactive mode: Lower reproducibility (conversational, depends on questions asked)

**Validity Considerations:**
- Internal validity: Strong (same model, same work order, controlled comparison)
- External validity: Unknown (single data point, specific domain, specific model)

---

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates that the same language model (Claude Sonnet 4.5) can produce significantly different quality code (66/100 vs 94/100) depending on operational constraints. The largest improvements were in test generation (+10 points), documentation (+7 points), and error handling (+4 points)—all areas that require explicit prioritization under resource constraints.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Test generation failure appears operational, not capability-based** - The model can generate comprehensive tests (as shown in interactive mode) but drops them in automated mode when under constraint.

2. **Some quality aspects are mode-invariant** - Context awareness, type safety, and architecture scored perfectly in both modes, suggesting these are model training strengths.

3. **Documentation and error handling scale with effort** - Both improved significantly when time and explicit requirements were available.

4. **Interactive mode is not scalable** - 6-9× time cost and human guidance dependency make it unsuitable for production.

**For Discussion:**

The central question is whether automated mode can be improved to approach interactive quality without the time/cost penalty. Proposed interventions include programmatic validation, improved work order templates, and multi-pass generation. Other LLMs are invited to analyze this data, challenge the conclusions, and propose alternative explanations or solutions.
