# Tier 1 Prompt Improvement - Acceptance Evaluation

**Work Order:** 787c6dd1 - Build Clipboard-WebView Coordination Layer
**PR:** #236
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Proposer:** gpt-4o-mini
**Refinement Cycles:** 2
**Final Errors:** 16 TypeScript errors
**Baseline (v109):** 65/100
**Target:** 73-77/100 (+8-12 points)

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL REGRESSION DETECTED**

**Final Score: 44/100**
**Change vs Baseline: -21 points (-32%)**
**Target Achievement: FAILED (expected +8-12, got -21)**

The Tier 1 prompt improvements (sandwich structure, token budgeting, provider-specific optimization) resulted in **significantly worse code quality** than the v109 baseline.

---

## Detailed Criterion Evaluation

### 1. No Placeholder Code (Priority 1 Rule) — **2/10** ❌

**Violations Found:**
- `ClipboardCoordinator.ts:47-65` — 5 empty method bodies:
  ```typescript
  private async prepareClipboard(data: { content: string }) {
      // preparation logic
  }
  private async writeClipboard(content: string) {
      // clipboard write logic
  }
  private async pasteClipboard() {
      // paste from clipboard logic
  }
  private async injectDataIntoWebview(webviewId: string, content: string) {
      // webview injection logic
  }
  ```
- `handleError()` line 69: `// rollback clipboard if necessary` (no implementation)
- `tests/../coordinationWorkflow.test.ts:14`: TODO comment in test

**Analysis:**
Despite Priority 1 rule "NO PLACEHOLDERS" appearing in CONCISE_CODE_RULES (constraints) and CRITICAL REMINDER (footer), gpt-4o-mini still generated 30% placeholder code (unchanged from v109).

**Score Justification:**
-8 points for 5 stub methods. This violates the #1 critical rule and makes the code non-functional.

---

### 2. Error Handling (Priority 1 Rule) — **6/10** ⚠️

**Present:**
- ✅ `startWorkflow()` has try-catch block
- ✅ `handleError()` method exists with specific error messages
- ✅ `FocusManager.focusWebView()` has try-catch
- ✅ Error messages are specific: "Workflow timeout exceeded 60 seconds", "Failed to focus WebView"

**Missing:**
- ❌ Empty methods (prepare, write, paste, inject) have NO error handling
- ❌ `verifyData()` doesn't validate or handle errors

**Analysis:**
Partial compliance. Main workflow path protected, but placeholder methods would crash if ever implemented.

**Score Justification:**
+6 for present error handling, -4 for missing coverage in sub-methods.

---

### 3. Input Validation (Priority 1 Rule) — **1/10** ❌

**Missing:**
- ❌ `startWorkflow(data)` — No validation of `content` or `webviewId` (null, undefined, empty, type)
- ❌ `focusWebView(webviewId)` — No validation before webContents.fromId() call
- ❌ No checks for empty strings, invalid format, or type mismatches

**Analysis:**
Complete failure of Priority 1 Rule #3. Code would crash on invalid inputs.

**Score Justification:**
+1 for type annotations (minimal), -9 for zero runtime validation.

---

### 4. Context Awareness (Priority 1 Rule) — **9/10** ✅

**Correct:**
- ✅ Uses Electron main process APIs: `ipcMain`, `webContents`, `EventEmitter`
- ✅ Imports use `@/main/...` prefix (correct for main process modules)
- ✅ Test uses `vitest` (correct for Node.js/main process)
- ✅ No React/DOM APIs in main process code
- ✅ IPC pattern correct: `ipcMain.on()` for main process handlers

**Analysis:**
Excellent. Model correctly identified Electron main process context and chose appropriate APIs.

**Score Justification:**
-1 for `webviewId` typed as string (should be number for `webContents.fromId()`), otherwise perfect.

---

### 5. Resource Cleanup (Priority 1 Rule) — **4/10** ⚠️

**Present:**
- ✅ `setTimeout` stored in `this.timeoutId` and cleared in `clearTimeout()`
- ✅ Timeout cleanup in `finally` block

**Missing:**
- ❌ `EventEmitter` never cleaned up (no `removeAllListeners()` or destroy method)
- ❌ IPC handlers registered in `setupIPC()` but NEVER removed (memory leak)
- ❌ No class cleanup/destroy method

**Analysis:**
Partial compliance. Timeout handled correctly, but EventEmitter and IPC handlers will leak.

**Score Justification:**
+4 for timeout cleanup, -6 for EventEmitter/IPC leaks.

---

### 6. Complete Implementation — **5/10** ⚠️

**Architecture Present:**
- ✅ State machine with all required transitions (idle → preparing → writing → pasting → injecting → waiting → complete)
- ✅ Timeout handling (60s workflow abort)
- ✅ Focus manager integration
- ✅ Error recovery pattern (handleError method)
- ✅ Event emission for status updates
- ✅ IPC handlers (workflow:start, workflow:abort)

**Missing Core Logic:**
- ❌ 5 stub methods with no implementation (50% of business logic)
- ❌ Rollback mechanism commented out
- ❌ Verification logic incomplete

**Analysis:**
Skeleton is excellent, but core functionality missing. Would fail all acceptance criteria if tested.

**Score Justification:**
+5 for architecture, -5 for missing implementations.

---

### 7. Tests — **3/10** ❌

**Present:**
- ✅ 2 test cases created
- ✅ Uses `vitest` (correct for main process)

**Broken:**
- ❌ First test accesses private property: `clipboardCoordinator.stateMachine.getCurrentState()` (will error - stateMachine is private)
- ❌ Second test is incomplete: `// Mock long execution and expect an error` (TODO comment, no assertions)
- ❌ No mocking of Electron APIs (ipcMain, webContents) - tests will crash
- ❌ No mock implementations for clipboard operations

**Analysis:**
Tests exist but are non-functional. Would fail to run.

**Score Justification:**
+3 for structure, -7 for broken implementation.

---

### 8. Type Safety — **4/10** ⚠️

**Present:**
- ✅ `State` enum properly defined with string values
- ✅ Method signatures have type annotations
- ✅ Import types from `@/types/workflow`

**Issues:**
- ❌ **16 TypeScript errors remain** after 2 refinement cycles (TS1109, TS1357 enum syntax errors)
- ❌ `webviewId` typed as `string` but `webContents.fromId()` expects `number`
- ❌ Error type in `handleError()` not validated (accepts any Error)

**Analysis:**
Code doesn't compile. Type system present but not enforced.

**Score Justification:**
+4 for types, -6 for compilation errors.

---

### 9. Architecture & Modularity — **9/10** ✅

**Excellent:**
- ✅ Separate files for each concern (Coordinator, StateMachine, FocusManager, IPC handlers, types, tests)
- ✅ Clear orchestration pattern (ClipboardCoordinator manages WorkflowStateMachine and FocusManager)
- ✅ Event-driven communication (EventEmitter)
- ✅ Proper separation of IPC layer from business logic
- ✅ Type definitions in separate file

**Analysis:**
Excellent modular design. Code structure is professional.

**Score Justification:**
-1 for IPC handlers duplicated in both `ClipboardCoordinator.setupIPC()` and `workflowHandlers.ts` (minor redundancy).

---

### 10. Documentation & Clarity — **1/10** ❌

**Missing:**
- ❌ No JSDoc comments on any class or method
- ❌ State machine transitions not documented (no explanation of workflow phases)
- ❌ No README or usage examples
- ❌ No inline explanatory comments (only placeholder TODOs)
- ❌ Error codes/states not documented

**Present:**
- Comments exist, but only placeholders: `// preparation logic`, `// clipboard write logic`

**Analysis:**
Code is undocumented. Future maintainer would need to reverse-engineer intent.

**Score Justification:**
+1 for minimal inline comments (even though they're TODOs), -9 for lack of real documentation.

## Failure Pattern Analysis

### Why Did Tier 1 Improvements Fail?

**1. Token Budget May Be Too Restrictive (6K for OpenAI)**
- Input tokens: 835 (within budget)
- But dependency context truncated to 30% = ~1800 tokens
- CONCISE_CODE_RULES only 5 lines vs 80-line DETAILED version
- Model may not have enough context to understand requirements

**2. Sandwich Structure Not Effective for GPT-4o-mini**
- Rules appeared in CONSTRAINTS (top) and CRITICAL REMINDER (bottom)
- Yet 80% of Priority 1 rules still failed
- Suggests gpt-4o-mini has attention issues beyond position bias

**3. Numbered Requirements May Have Confused Model**
- Task description converted to numbered list
- But WO description is already structured
- May have introduced noise instead of clarity

**4. Loss of Detailed Examples**
- v109 had 80-line DETAILED_CODE_RULES with examples
- Tier 1 used 5-line CONCISE version (no examples)
- Model may need examples to understand abstract rules

**5. Model Capability Ceiling**
- gpt-4o-mini may simply not be capable of following complex rules
- Complexity 0.975 (very high) routed to gpt-4o-mini (should route to Claude?)
- Routing issue may be root cause, not prompt issue

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis (Updated from v109)

| Hypothesis | Likelihood | Evidence |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Text-only rules insufficient | **Very High** | 80% rule failure rate persists with improved positioning |
| Model capability ceiling (gpt-4o-mini) | **Critical** | Regression despite prompt improvements suggests model limit |
| Competing instructions (syntax vs semantics) | High | 2 refinement cycles focused on syntax (TS1109/TS1357), ignored placeholders |
| Token budget too restrictive | High | 835 input tokens may be below optimal for this complexity |
| No programmatic enforcement | **Very High** | Manual inspection found issues refinement missed |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (v110 continuation)

**DO NOT proceed with Tier 2 or additional prompt improvements.**

**Instead:**

1. **Test Model Capability Hypothesis (2 hours)**
   - Re-run WO-787c6dd1 with `claude-3.5-sonnet` using SAME Tier 1 prompts
   - Compare scores to isolate prompt vs model capability
   - If Claude scores >75/100, it's a routing problem not a prompt problem

2. **Fix Routing Logic (4 hours)**
   - Investigate why complexity 0.975 routes to gpt-4o-mini instead of Claude
   - Check budget constraints and daily spend limits
   - Verify proposer availability and thresholds

3. **Implement Tier 3 Validator (Highest Priority - 10 hours)**
   - Prompt improvements alone won't work - need programmatic validation
   - Build completeness validator to catch placeholders, missing error handling, etc.
   - Integrate into refinement loop BEFORE syntax checking

### Deferred Actions

- ❌ Tier 2 (Concrete Examples) — Skip unless model test proves capability
- ❌ Additional prompt restructuring — Diminishing returns evident
- ✅ Tier 3 (Programmatic Validation) — Only reliable path forward

## Evidence Files

- **PR:** https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1/pull/236
- **Code Diff:** 157 additions, 0 deletions across 6 files
- **Metadata:** `check-execution-results.ts` output with refinement cycle details
- **Baseline Comparison:** v109 evaluation (65/100)

---

**Evaluation Date:** 2025-10-21
**Evaluator:** Claude Code (Session v110)
**Conclusion:** Tier 1 prompt improvements ineffective for gpt-4o-mini. Likely model capability issue, not prompt design. Recommend A/B test with Claude and shift focus to programmatic validation (Tier 3).
