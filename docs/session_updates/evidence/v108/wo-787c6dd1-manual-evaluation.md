## Acceptance Criteria Evaluation

### ✅ AC-001: ClipboardCoordinator class manages workflow state machine
**Score: 8/10** (Threshold: 7) **PASS**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Class exists | ✅ `ClipboardCoordinator` found | 3/3 |
| State machine present | ✅ `stateMachine` field, `transitionTo()` calls | 3/3 |
| Methods exist | ✅ `startWorkflow`, `getState` equivalent | 2/2 |
| Implements interface | ❌ No interface/type definition | 0/2 |

**Details:**
- Class properly instantiates `WorkflowStateMachine`
- Delegates state transitions to state machine
- Missing: Formal interface definition (IClipboardCoordinator)

---

### ✅ AC-002: State transitions tracked: idle → preparing → writing → pasting → injecting → waiting → complete
**Score: 7/10** (Threshold: 7) **PASS**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Enum/type with required states | ✅ All 7 states in array: `['idle', 'preparing', 'writing', 'pasting', 'injecting', 'waiting', 'complete', 'error']` | 4/4 |
| State transition logic | ✅ `transitionTo()` with validation (lines 7-12 in WorkflowStateMachine.ts) | 3/3 |
| State validation | ❌ No throw on invalid transitions | 0/3 |

**Details:**
- All required states present
- Transition method validates state exists in array
- Missing: Error throwing for invalid transitions (just silently ignores)

---

### ❌ AC-003: Timing coordinator ensures proper sequencing with configurable delays
**Score: 3/10** (Threshold: 7) **FAIL**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Delay mechanism | ❌ No `setTimeout` for sequencing delays | 0/3 |
| Configurable timing | ❌ `TIMEOUT_DURATION` exists but no inter-stage delays | 0/4 |
| Sequence coordination | ✅ Methods called in sequence (async pattern) | 3/3 |

**Details:**
- Code executes states synchronously without delays
- Only timeout is for overall workflow (60s), not stage delays
- Missing: Configurable delays between write → paste → inject stages
- **Critical gap:** Real clipboard operations need timing coordination

---

### ❌ AC-004: Focus manager switches between webviews and verifies focus before paste
**Score: 3/10** (Threshold: 7) **FAIL**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Focus management | ⚠️ `FocusManager` exists but is placeholder | 1/3 |
| Focus verification | ⚠️ `checkFocus()` called but returns hardcoded `true` | 2/4 |
| Webview switching | ❌ No ability to switch between webviews | 0/3 |

**Details:**
- FocusManager.ts is 7-line placeholder
- `checkFocus()` always returns true (line 4)
- No parameters for target webview
- **Critical gap:** Cannot target specific providers

---

### ❌ AC-005: Error recovery handles failures at each stage
**Score: 3/10** (Threshold: 7) **FAIL**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Try-catch blocks | ❌ Zero try-catch blocks in code | 0/3 |
| Specific error handling | ❌ No clipboard/paste/injection failure handling | 0/4 |
| Error recovery logic | ✅ `rollback()` method exists (placeholder) | 3/3 |

**Details:**
- No error handling for actual operations
- `writeToClipboard()` hardcoded to return true (line 34)
- `rollback()` exists but is empty placeholder (lines 60-62)
- **Critical gap:** No actual recovery implementation

---

### ❌ AC-006: Rollback mechanism reverts clipboard content on workflow failure
**Score: 6/10** (Threshold: 8) **FAIL**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| State backup | ❌ No original clipboard content saved | 0/4 |
| Rollback implementation | ✅ `rollback()` method exists (line 60) | 4/4 |
| Rollback on error | ✅ Called in error state handler (line 55) | 2/2 |

**Details:**
- `rollback()` called correctly on error
- Method is empty placeholder
- No variable to store original clipboard state
- **Critical gap:** Cannot actually restore clipboard

---

### ✅ AC-007: Event emitter broadcasts workflow progress to renderer process
**Score: 7/10** (Threshold: 7) **PASS**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Event emitter pattern | ✅ `EventEmitter` used, `emit()` called | 3/3 |
| Progress events | ✅ `emit('workflow:status', { state })` on transitions | 4/4 |
| Renderer communication | ❌ Uses EventEmitter instead of `webContents.send()` | 0/3 |

**Details:**
- Proper event-driven architecture
- Progress emitted on every state change
- **Issue:** Pattern won't reach renderer (EventEmitter is main process only)
- Should use `BrowserWindow.webContents.send()` for renderer communication

---

### ✅ AC-008: IPC handlers for workflow:start, workflow:status, workflow:abort channels
**Score: 9/10** (Threshold: 8) **PASS**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| IPC handler registration | ✅ 3 `ipcMain.on()` calls | 3/3 |
| Specific channels | ✅ All 3 required channels present: `workflow:start`, `workflow:status`, `workflow:abort` | 5/5 |
| Handler implementation | ⚠️ Start works, status/abort incomplete | 1/2 |

**Details:**
- All IPC channels registered
- `workflow:start` fully functional
- `workflow:status` has issue: creates new listener on every call (memory leak)
- `workflow:abort` is TODO comment
- **Good:** Clean separation in dedicated handlers file

---

### ✅ AC-009: Integration tests validate full workflow with mock webviews
**Score: 7/10** (Threshold: 5, Weight: 0.5) **PASS** (Optional)

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Test file exists | ✅ `coordinationWorkflow.test.ts` | 3/3 |
| Integration test present | ✅ `test('full workflow integration test')` | 4/4 |
| Mock webviews | ❌ No mocking, incorrect imports (`@testing-library/react` for non-React code) | 0/3 |

**Details:**
- Test validates workflow progression
- **Issue:** Imports React testing lib for Electron main process code
- Test will fail to run (wrong testing framework)
- No webview mocking

---

### ✅ AC-010: Timeout handling aborts workflow after 60s with detailed error state
**Score: 8/10** (Threshold: 7) **PASS**

| Check | Result | Points |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Timeout constant | ✅ `TIMEOUT_DURATION = 60000` (60s) | 2/2 |
| Timeout mechanism | ✅ `setTimeout()` in `startTimeout()` (lines 64-68) | 3/3 |
| Abort on timeout | ✅ Transitions to 'error' state on timeout | 3/3 |
| Detailed error state | ❌ No context about timeout vs other errors | 0/2 |

**Details:**
- Timeout correctly set to 60 seconds
- Properly cleared on completion
- **Missing:** Error state doesn't indicate timeout (vs other failures)

---

## Summary

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Score** | **61/100** |
| **Percentage** | **61%** |
| **Grade** | **D** |
| **Pass Threshold** | 70% |
| **Result** | **❌ FAIL** |

### Acceptance Criteria Results
- **Passing (≥threshold):** 5/10 (AC-001, AC-002, AC-007, AC-008, AC-010)
- **Failing (<threshold):** 5/10 (AC-003, AC-004, AC-005, AC-006, AC-009)

---

## Critical Gaps

### 1. **Placeholder Implementations** (Completeness Issue)
```typescript
private writeToClipboard(content: string): boolean {
    // Placeholder for writing to clipboard logic
    return true
}

private rollback(): void {
    // Placeholder for rollback logic
}

public checkFocus(): boolean {
    // Placeholder for focus checking logic
    return true
}
```
**Impact:** Core functionality not implemented

### 2. **No Error Handling** (Reliability Issue)
- Zero try-catch blocks
- No validation of clipboard operations
- Hardcoded success returns

### 3. **No Timing Coordination** (AC-003 Failure)
- Executes all stages synchronously
- No delays between write → paste → inject
- Real clipboard operations need timing

### 4. **FocusManager is Stub** (AC-004 Failure)
- 7-line placeholder class
- Cannot target specific webviews
- No actual focus verification

### 5. **Test Framework Mismatch** (AC-009 Issue)
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
```
- React testing lib imported for Electron main process code
- Tests will not run

## Comparison with Orchestrator's Built-in Validator

| Dimension | Orchestrator | My Evaluation | Match? |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Architecture** | 5/10 | ✅ Structure good, placeholders bad | ✅ |
| **Readability** | 6/10 | ✅ Clean code, well organized | ✅ |
| **Completeness** | 2/10 | ❌ Major placeholders, missing implementations | ✅ |
| **Test Coverage** | 0/10 | ❌ Tests exist but won't run (wrong framework) | ✅ |
| **Build Success** | 0/10 | ❓ Didn't check compilation | N/A |
| **Overall** | 2.7/10 | 61/100 ≈ 6.1/10 | ⚠️ |

**Analysis of Discrepancy:**
- Orchestrator scored 2.7/10 (27%)
- My evaluation: 61/100 (61%)
- **Difference:** +34 percentage points

**Reasons:**
1. **Orchestrator weights Build/Tests heavily** - Both scored 0/10
2. **My criteria rewards partial implementations** - Structure exists even if incomplete
3. **Different evaluation philosophies:**
   - Orchestrator: "Does it work?" (Runtime validation)
   - My approach: "Is it present?" (Code inspection)

**Which is more accurate?**
- **Orchestrator is correct** for production readiness
- **My approach is better** for training feedback (shows what's missing specifically)

## Actionable Feedback for Training

If this were training data for 4o-mini, the feedback would be:

### ✅ **What Worked**
1. Correct architectural structure (Coordinator + StateMachine + FocusManager separation)
2. All required IPC channels implemented
3. Event-driven design pattern
4. Timeout handling present
5. State machine with all required states

### ❌ **What Failed**
1. **Replace ALL placeholders with real implementations**
   - `writeToClipboard()` must use Electron clipboard API
   - `rollback()` must save/restore original content
   - `checkFocus()` must verify actual webview focus

2. **Add timing coordination**
   ```typescript
   await delay(config.writeDelay)
   await clipboard.write()
   await delay(config.pasteDelay)
   await performPaste()
   ```

3. **Implement error handling**
   - Try-catch around clipboard operations
   - Specific error types (ClipboardError, PasteError, etc.)
   - Recovery strategies per AC-005

4. **Fix test framework**
   - Use Vitest/Jest for Node.js, not @testing-library/react
   - Mock webviews properly

5. **Make FocusManager functional**
   - Accept webview ID parameter
   - Actually verify focus before paste

---

## Recommendation

**For Production:** ❌ **REJECT** - Too many critical gaps

**For Training Iteration:** ✅ **EXCELLENT FEEDBACK DATA**
- Clear structure shows understanding
- Specific gaps are actionable
- Next iteration can fix each placeholder

**Scoring Approach Effectiveness:** ✅ **VALIDATED**
- My structured criteria identified exactly what's missing
- More actionable than orchestrator's numeric scores
