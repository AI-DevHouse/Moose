üîç ANALYSIS

Scoring format detected:
   Old scoring (0-100): ‚ùå NOT FOUND
   New scoring (0-10):  ‚úÖ FOUND

‚ö†Ô∏è  DISCREPANCY: Analysis doc shows scores out of 100
   but database shows scores out of 10
   
Possible causes:
   1. Acceptance validator was updated to use 0-10 scale
   2. Historical scores were from different validation method
   3. Historical scores were manually entered/estimated
