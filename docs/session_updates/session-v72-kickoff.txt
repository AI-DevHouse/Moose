  Critical: v71 fixed Aider Git detection race condition. Phase 1 ready for retry.

  Your task: Execute Phase 1 retry with 5 work orders (Claude Sonnet 4.5).

  Expected outcome: ≥80% success rate (4-5 of 5 WOs complete with commits and PRs).

  Monitor closely: Watch for "Git detection primed successfully" in Aider logs.
