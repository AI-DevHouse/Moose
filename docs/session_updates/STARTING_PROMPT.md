# STARTING PROMPT — Moose Mission Control (auto‑locating)

You are resuming development for **Moose Mission Control**.

Session files live in:
  `C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session_updates\`

**Do this in order:**

1) Locate and open **SESSION_HANDOVER_MASTER.md**, **SESSION_START_QUICK.md**, and the **latest** file matching:
   `session-v*-*-handover.md` (choose the highest version number OR newest timestamp).

2) From MASTER:
   - Read **§5.1 “Working Behaviour Standards.”**
   - **Confirm compliance in ≤1 sentence** before any action.

3) From the latest handover:
   - Summarise the **Δ Summary** and **Next Actions** in ≤3 bullets.
   - Set your current working goal accordingly.

4) Follow **SESSION_START_QUICK.md** workflow next.

5) **Context boundaries:**
   - Keep only MASTER, QUICK, and the latest handover in context.
   - Reference `/evidence/` or `/archive/` by **path only**; do **not** load raw logs.

**Respond when complete with:**
- One-line compliance confirmation for MASTER §5.1.
- ≤3-bullet summary of current session goal derived from the latest handover.
