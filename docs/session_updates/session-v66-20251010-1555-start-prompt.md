# Session Start Prompt v66 - Continue Iteration 1

## Context

Read the complete handover document first:
```
C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session-v65-handover.md
```

## Current Status

✅ **Orchestrator daemon RUNNING in background**
✅ **3 PRs completed successfully** (#8, #9, #10)
✅ **Critical timeout bug FIXED** (60s → 600s)
✅ **0 failures since fix** (100% success rate post-fix)
⏳ **10 WOs currently executing**
⏸️ **24 WOs pending**

## Your Task

**Primary:** Monitor orchestrator daemon execution, analyze results when complete

**Do NOT:**
- Kill the running daemon (bash_id: 4ef0e6)
- Make code changes that would require rebuild
- Apply database migrations yet

**DO:**
- Check daemon status immediately
- Monitor progress every 10-15 minutes
- Analyze results when complete
- Update documentation with findings

---

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Check Daemon Status (First Thing)
```bash
# Method 1: Check overall project status
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-project-status.ts

# Method 2: Monitor daemon output (if needed)
# Use BashOutput tool with bash_id: 4ef0e6
```

**What to look for:**
- Is daemon still running?
- How many WOs completed/failed/pending?
- Any new error patterns?

### 2. Monitor Until Complete

Check status every 10-15 minutes. Expected completion: ~30-60 minutes from handover.

### 3. When Complete, Analyze Results

Run analysis:
```bash
# Final status
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-project-status.ts

# Detailed WO list
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-with-env.ps1 scripts/check-all-wos.ts
```

Update `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md` with:
- Final success rate
- Failure patterns
- Cost breakdown
- Recommendations

## CRITICAL SESSION RULES (FROM USER)

### Rule 1: Read Schema Before Editing

**ALWAYS read complete schema before ANY database/query changes:**

```bash
Read: C:\dev\moose-mission-control\scripts\create-production-schema.sql
```

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Using `is_active` (wrong - it's `active` in proposer_configs)
- ❌ Using `model_name` (wrong - it's `model` in proposer_configs)
- ✅ Check schema first, then query/modify

**Schema locations in code:**
- Line 44: `proposer_configs.active` (NOT `is_active`)
- Line 40: `proposer_configs.model` (NOT `model_name`)
- Line 104: `contracts.is_active` (different naming!)

### Rule 2: Read Complete Files Before Editing

**Never edit without reading entire file first:**
- Use Read tool to see full file
- Verify line numbers match current state
- Check context around changes
- Understand what code does before modifying

### Rule 3: Minimize Terminal Output

**User wants concise responses:**
- Keep terminal output short
- Write longer analysis to files
- Reference file paths instead of pasting content
- Goal: Maximize working time before context limit

**Good:**
```
✅ Analysis complete. See: analysis-results.md
✅ 5 PRs created successfully
```

**Bad:**
```
❌ [500 lines of JSON output]
❌ [Complete file contents pasted]
❌ [Verbose explanations in terminal]
```

### Rule 4: Use Files for Documentation

**Create files, don't paste:**
- Write analysis to `.md` files
- Save logs to `.txt` files
- Reference paths in responses
- Let user read at their pace

## Key Files Reference

**Main tracking doc:**
```
C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\iteration-1-changes-needed.md
```
- 12 issues documented (Issues 10-12 added this session)
- Use this to track findings

**Handover doc (read this!):**
```
C:\dev\moose-mission-control\docs\session-v65-handover.md
```
- Complete session history
- Daemon status
- Bug fixes applied
- What to do next

**Schema (READ BEFORE QUERYING!):**
```
C:\dev\moose-mission-control\scripts\create-production-schema.sql
```

**Status check scripts:**
```bash
# Overall status
scripts/check-project-status.ts

# Detailed WO list
scripts/check-all-wos.ts

# Specific WO details
scripts/check-wo-details.ts [wo-id]

# Proposer routing
scripts/check-proposers.ts
```

## Project Context

**Project:** Multi-LLM Discussion App v1 (Electron desktop app)
- **Local path:** C:\dev\multi-llm-discussion-v1
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/AI-DevHouse/multi-llm-discussion-v1
- **Supabase project:** f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951
- **Budget:** $150
- **Work orders:** 49 total

**What's running:**
- Orchestrator daemon (bash_id: 4ef0e6)
- Polling for work orders every 10 seconds
- Max 3 concurrent executions
- Using claude-sonnet-4-5 (capacity: 2/2) and gpt-4o-mini (capacity: 4/4)

---

## Success Criteria

**Target:** >60% success rate (30+ of 49 WOs succeed)
**Budget:** <$150 total
**Quality:** Code builds and runs

**Current trajectory:**
- Post-fix: 100% success (3/3)
- Pre-fix: 15 failures (old timeout bug)
- Expected final: ~70-80% success rate

---

## What Was Fixed This Session

**Bug #7: Orchestrator Timeout (CRITICAL)**
- **File:** `src/lib/orchestrator/orchestrator-service.ts:213`
- **Problem:** Hardcoded 60s timeout caused 75% failure rate
- **Fix:** Removed hardcode, now uses 600s (10min) default
- **Result:** 0 failures since fix, 3/3 successes
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED, built, daemon restarted with fix

---

## Pending Tasks (Don't Apply Yet)

**Complexity Score Migration (Prepared):**
- SQL: `scripts/add-complexity-score-column.sql`
- Code: `scripts/complexity-score-code-changes.md`
- **Wait until:** Current iteration completes
- **Why:** Adds direct column for easier querying

**Issues to Investigate:**
- Issue #12: Routing mismatch (Claude selected, GPT executed)
- 15 old failures from first run (analyze patterns)

---

## Quick Start Checklist

On session start, do this:

- [ ] Read handover doc: `docs/session-v65-handover.md`
- [ ] Check daemon status: `scripts/check-project-status.ts`
- [ ] Verify daemon still running (bash_id: 4ef0e6)
- [ ] Note: DO NOT kill daemon or rebuild yet
- [ ] Monitor every 10-15 min until complete
- [ ] When done: Analyze results
- [ ] Update: `docs/iteration-1-changes-needed.md`
- [ ] Document: Final metrics and recommendations

---

## Expected Timeline

**From handover (14:50):**
- +10 min: Check first status update
- +20 min: ~3 more PRs expected
- +30 min: ~6 more PRs expected
- +45 min: ~9 more PRs expected
- +60 min: Possibly complete or nearly complete

**If complete:**
- Run final analysis
- Calculate success rate
- Document findings
- Plan next steps

**If still running:**
- Continue monitoring
- Check for new issues
- Be patient (WOs take 3-5 min each)

---

**Start by reading the handover doc, then check daemon status. Good luck! 🚀**
