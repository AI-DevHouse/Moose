# Session v146 Handover — 2025-10-29 18:20

## Result
✅ Success — Full system reset complete; proposer error analysis begun; ready for diagnostic investigation

## Δ Summary (Changes since v145)

1. **Session Orientation Complete**: Loaded MASTER §§5.1-5.3, QUICK, v144 handover, BRIEF, SCRIPTS, DB_CONTRACT; confirmed v144 state (42 in_progress, 7 failed, orchestrator stopped ~2.5h prior)
2. **Full System Reset Executed**: Used pre-existing scripts to clean entire system:
   - `cleanup-github-prs-and-branches.ts`: 47 PRs closed (#358-#505), 47 remote branches deleted
   - `remove-physical-worktrees.ts`: All 15 worktrees removed, pruned, local branches cleaned
   - `reset-wos-to-pending.ts`: 49 WOs reset from (42 in_progress + 7 failed) → 49 pending
3. **Reset Verified**: 0 PRs, 0 branches, only main worktree remains, 49 WOs pending, system clean
4. **Proposer Error Analysis Started**: Read `Discussion - Proposer_Error_Fix(1).txt` and provided critical technical review identifying data integrity concerns (doc claims ~0% first-pass vs v144's 90% success)
5. **Investigation Scoped**: Identified need for Phase 0 diagnostic before implementing proposed fixes — analyze 7 failed WOs from v144, validate sanitizer behavior, determine actual vs claimed failure modes

## Next Actions

1. **Create diagnostic script** `analyze-v144-failures.ts` to:
   - Query 7 failed WOs from v144 (status='failed', project_id='f73e8c9f-1d78-4251-8fb6-a070fd857951')
   - Extract execution_error logs, proposer output, aider logs
   - Categorize failure modes (generation vs application vs compilation)
   - Determine if TS1005 ("',' expected") actually dominates as claimed
2. **Validate sanitizer claims**:
   - Examine `src/lib/sanitizers/code-sanitizer.ts` for `fixTrailingCommasOrSemicolons()` function
   - Test if sanitizer actually removes commas/semicolons as document claims
   - Determine if sanitizer is root cause or red herring
3. **Review Aider integration**:
   - Check `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts` for how it handles proposer output
   - Determine if failures occur during code generation or code application
4. **Data-driven decision**: Based on diagnostic results, either:
   - If <20% failure rate → minimal targeted fixes only
   - If sanitizer confirmed destructive → implement non-destructive passes
   - If Aider application issue → focus there, not prompts
   - If infrastructure-related → different solution entirely

## Watchpoints

- **Proposer fix document premise unvalidated**: Claims ~0% first-pass compile success; v144 showed 90% success (44/49 executed, 43 PRs created) — investigate before implementing 2-week, 3-phase rollout
- **Data integrity gap**: Document written before logs complete; metrics may not reflect actual system behavior
- **Missing middle step**: Document focuses on Proposer→tsc flow but ignores Aider's role in applying code changes; Aider could be actual failure point
- **Context at 74%**: Loaded substantial evidence during analysis; prioritize diagnostic work early in next session before context fills
- **No decomposition_metadata exists**: Bootstrap status shows as "undefined" because decomposition_metadata table is empty; investigate if this affects WO execution

## Compliance

N1 ✓ N6 ✓ N7 ✓ (Read MASTER/QUICK/v144; minimal context maintained; used existing scripts from registry)

## Scripts Used (Pre-existing)

- `cleanup-github-prs-and-branches.ts` — Close all PRs and delete all feature branches via gh CLI
- `remove-physical-worktrees.ts` — Remove all worktrees, prune, and clean local branches
- `reset-wos-to-pending.ts` — Reset all WOs to pending status for clean re-execution

## Scripts Created (Diagnostic utilities for next session)

- `check-wo-status-summary.ts` — Get WO status distribution for MLD project (quick status check)
- `debug-db-state.ts` — Show all projects and WO counts (database exploration)
- `check-wo-details-v145.ts` — Get detailed status of in_progress and failed WOs (expanded diagnostics)
- `raw-wo-query.ts` — Test query to verify WO data access (troubleshooting)
- `check-current-state-v145.ts` — Get current WO state using correct schema (final verification)

## Database State

- **Work Orders**: 49 pending (clean slate)
- **GitHub**: 0 open PRs, 0 feature branches
- **Worktrees**: Only main worktree at C:/dev/multi-llm-discussion-v1 (23c11d7)
- **Multi-LLM-Discussion-v1**: Main branch clean, ready for orchestrator run

**Version:** v146
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-29 18:20
**Next Session:** v147
**Priority:** Run Phase 0 diagnostics before implementing proposer fixes; validate document claims with actual failure data
