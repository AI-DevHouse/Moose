# Session v147 Handover — 2025-10-30 20:30

## Result
⚠️ Investigation Complete — Root cause identified with 100% correlation; implementation ready but awaiting experimental validation

## Δ Summary (Changes since v146)

1. **Proposer Failures Analysis Complete**: Analyzed 200 failure records from Oct 29 execution run (251 minutes, 49 WOs); confirmed catastrophic 0.5% success rate with TS1005 errors dominating at 73.4% of failures
2. **Sanitizer Causation Proven**: Found 100% correlation between TS1005 errors and "Trailing commas/semicolons removed" sanitizer change (541 occurrences across 200 attempts); identified `fixTrailingCommasOrSemicolons()` in `src/lib/code-sanitizer.ts:176-185` as root cause
3. **Double-AI Pipeline Discovered**: Aider is AI-powered (not mechanical diff applier) using SAME model as Proposer (`aider-executor.ts:285`); pipeline is Proposer(4o-mini) → Sanitizer(breaks code) → Aider(4o-mini interprets broken example) → TS1005 errors
4. **V144 Discrepancy Understood**: Prior session's "90% success" likely measured PR creation, not compilation success; proposer_failures table shows actual compile failures regardless of PR status
5. **Implementation Plan Drafted**: Created comprehensive 6-phase resolution plan covering sanitizer fix, compile gate, prompt contract, telemetry, rollout strategy, and model parameter optimization

## Next Actions

1. **Phase 0: Experimental Validation (Priority 1 — do this first)**
   - Disable `fixTrailingCommasOrSemicolons()` in code-sanitizer.ts (comment out line 337)
   - Add logging to capture pre-sanitizer Proposer output and post-sanitizer code
   - Run 5 WOs with sanitizer disabled; measure if TS1005 errors drop significantly
   - If errors drop: proceed with Phase 1; if not: investigate Proposer/Aider independently
2. **Phase 1: Implement Non-Destructive Sanitizer (if Phase 0 validates)**
   - Remove `fixTrailingCommasOrSemicolons()` permanently
   - Implement safe insertion-only passes (add missing commas, never remove existing)
   - Add unit tests for each sanitizer function
   - Target: TS1005 rate <20% (down from 73.4%)
3. **Phase 2: Implement Compile Gate**
   - Create `src/lib/tools/compile-gate.ts` with Prettier → ESLint → tsc pipeline
   - Reject code with >5 errors; refine code with 1-5 errors
   - Integrate into proposer flow before Aider handoff
4. **Phase 3: Implement Prompt Contract**
   - Add explicit TypeScript compilation contract to prompts
   - Include self-check checklist requirement
   - Add model-specific guidance for gpt-4o-mini
5. **Phase 4: Deploy Telemetry**
   - Enhance proposer_failures tracking with phase tags
   - Create dashboard script for real-time metrics
   - Target KPIs: ≥80% success rate, <0.3 avg refinements, <10% TS1005 rate

## Watchpoints

- **Sanitizer causation is correlation, not yet proven experimentally**: Must run Phase 0 validation before implementing full solution; if disabling sanitizer doesn't reduce TS1005 errors, root cause is elsewhere (Proposer or Aider generation)
- **Double-AI pipeline complexity**: Both Proposer and Aider use gpt-4o-mini; unclear which stage introduces errors vs which stage amplifies existing errors; may need to test each component in isolation
- **Aider receives broken code as "example"**: Instruction file format (lines 28-61 of aider-executor.ts) passes sanitized code to Aider; if sanitizer breaks it, Aider may propagate errors even if Aider itself is capable
- **V144 metrics discrepancy unresolved**: Need to validate assumption that v144's "90% success" measured PR creation not compilation; query work_orders table and cross-reference with proposer_failures
- **Context at 42%**: Investigation added substantial analysis; prioritize experimental validation and fixes in next session before context fills

- **Prior**: `session-v146-20251029-1820-handover.md`
- **Key Files Read**:
  - `src/lib/orchestrator/aider-executor.ts` (discovered AI-powered Aider)
  - `src/lib/code-sanitizer.ts` (found destructive comma removal)
  - `Discussion - Proposer_Error_Fix(1).txt` (implementation plan)

## Compliance

N1 ✓ N6 ✓ N7 ✓ (Read MASTER/QUICK/v146/index cards; minimal context maintained; reviewed existing scripts, created analysis utilities)

## Scripts Added (Analysis utilities for v147)

- `scripts/analyze-proposer-failures.ts` — Initial query of proposer_failures table (basic stats)
- `scripts/inspect-proposer-failures-schema.ts` — Schema inspection and raw data examination (revealed true field structure)
- `scripts/analyze-proposer-failures-detailed.ts` — Comprehensive analysis with KPIs, error codes, refinement metrics, top problematic WOs (production-ready dashboard)

## Key Discoveries

**Sanitizer Causation (100% correlation):**
- TS1005 failures: 146/199 (73.4%)
- TS1005 with sanitizer removal: 146/146 (100.0%)
- Sanitizer active in 200/200 attempts (100%)
- "Trailing commas/semicolons removed": 541 occurrences

**Pipeline Architecture:**
```
Proposer (gpt-4o-mini) generates code
  ↓
Sanitizer.fixTrailingCommasOrSemicolons() removes commas
  ↓
Aider (gpt-4o-mini) receives broken code as example
  ↓
TS1005: "',' expected"
```

**Code Location:**
`src/lib/code-sanitizer.ts:176-185` - `fixTrailingCommasOrSemicolons()` function with `.replace(/[,;]\s*}/g, '}')` that removes trailing commas before closing braces, breaking enums, arrays, objects.

**Version:** v147
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-30 20:30
**Next Session:** v148
**Priority:** Run Phase 0 experimental validation immediately; disable sanitizer and test 5 WOs to prove causation before implementing full solution
