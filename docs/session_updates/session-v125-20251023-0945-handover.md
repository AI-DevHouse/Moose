**Result:** ⚠️ DEPENDENCY CHAIN VALIDATED BUT CI FAILURES EXPOSE BOOTSTRAP SCOPE GAP

**Δ Summary:**
- Investigated completeness score issue from v124 (3.75/10): Root cause is build failures cascade to automatic 2/10 completeness (not proposer quality issue)
- Fixed race condition: Added bootstrap WO (14b6ea23) as dependency to 5 feature WOs, ensuring sequential execution via dependency-resolver.ts
- Identified critical merge workflow flaw: Feature WOs branch from `main`, but bootstrap changes are on unmerged branch → manually merged PR #300 before feature execution
- Executed 6-WO test (1 bootstrap + 5 features): 100% execution success (6/6 PRs created), but 0/6 CI passed due to missing package-lock.json
- Discovered bootstrap scope gap: Bootstrap WO updated tsconfig.json/.env.example but didn't create/commit package-lock.json (in .gitignore, never committed)
- Created comprehensive analysis: `evidence/v124/bulk-test-results-analysis.md` documenting workflow fixes (✅) and infrastructure gaps (❌)

**Next Actions:**
1. **Fix bootstrap generator scope** (HIGH): Modify `bootstrap-wo-generator.ts` to include package-lock.json creation, run `npm install` if missing, ensure lock file committed
2. **Commit lock file to project** (HIGH): Remove `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` in multi-llm-discussion-v1, commit to main branch
3. **Implement dependency-aware branching** (MEDIUM): Modify `aider-executor.ts` createFeatureBranch() to branch from dependency's branch instead of `main` (eliminates manual merge requirement)
4. **Run local acceptance validation** (LOW): Test acceptance-validator.ts directly on PRs to bypass CI dependency, verify completeness scoring logic
5. **Document status workflow** (LOW): Clarify "in_progress" (PR created) vs "completed" (PR merged) status management for users

**Watchpoints:**
- Bootstrap WO scope MUST include ALL CI prerequisites (package-lock.json, not just source files) - current gap blocks all downstream validation
- package-lock.json in .gitignore is catastrophic for CI - blocks GitHub Actions setup-node from installing dependencies
- Dependency chain enforcement works BUT requires manual PR merges between dependent WOs (workflow friction point)
- Orchestrator leaves WOs at "in_progress" after PR creation (expected behavior) - only become "completed" when PR merged (manual or webhook)
- Acceptance validation currently blocked by CI failures - completeness scores will remain 2/10 until lock file issue fixed
