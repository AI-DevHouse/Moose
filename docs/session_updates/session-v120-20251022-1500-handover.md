**Result:** ✅ BOOTSTRAP SYSTEM FULLY VALIDATED END-TO-END

**Δ Summary:**
- Merged PR #251 (bootstrap infrastructure) to establish baseline in multi-llm-discussion-v1 project
- Performed rapid reset, approved only 10 new feature WOs from 2025-10-22 decomposition (isolated from 49 older WOs)
- Executed orchestrator: 9/10 WOs succeeded, creating PRs #264-272 with valid, compilable TypeScript/React code
- Validated bootstrap end-to-end: feature WOs successfully built on bootstrap infrastructure, Aider fixed all proposer errors (0-46 range)
- Confirmed proposer→Aider pipeline works: initial syntax errors reliably corrected, final committed code is clean
- 90% success rate achieved; one Aider execution failure (WO-20ce631d, exit code null) requires investigation

**Next Actions:**
1. **Production safety:** Add `DISABLE_BOOTSTRAP_INJECTION` env var feature flag for emergency rollback capability (5 min, critical)
2. **CI/CD setup:** Add GitHub Actions to multi-llm-discussion-v1 for automated TypeScript compilation checks on PRs (30 min)
3. **Failure investigation:** Review logs for WO-20ce631d Aider crash (exit code null), determine if reproducible (15 min)
4. **Quality monitoring:** Track proposer error counts over next 20+ WOs; improve prompts only if consistently >20 errors
5. **Feature progression:** Review and merge successful PRs #264-272 to continue building chat application feature set

**Watchpoints:**
- Bootstrap system production-ready but MUST add kill switch (DISABLE_BOOTSTRAP_INJECTION) before deployment
- Proposer generates 0-46 syntax errors per WO (Aider fixes all, but consumes tokens/time)
- Multi-llm-discussion-v1 repo has no CI/CD checks - all PR validation currently manual
- 49 old WOs (created 2025-10-10) remain pending - unrelated to bootstrap validation, may need separate cleanup
- Token usage at 51% (102k/200k) - sufficient headroom for next session

**Status:** Handover Complete
**Next:** v121 - Add production safety features (kill switch, CI/CD), investigate Aider failure, monitor quality metrics
