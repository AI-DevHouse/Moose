**Start here each session.** Reference other docs as needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Session Handover Protocol

**üö® ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY - MUST DO BEFORE CONTEXT RUNS OUT üö®**

**When to Update:** At **80-85% of context budget used** (160,000-170,000 tokens of 200,000), pause at the next logical task completion point.

**What Happens if Skipped:** Catastrophic loss of session progress - next session will not know what was accomplished, leading to duplicate work, confusion, and wasted time.

**Update Checklist (REQUIRED):**
1. ‚úÖ Update "Last Session Summary" section with completed work
2. ‚úÖ Update "Current Status" with new completions
3. ‚úÖ Update "Next Immediate Task" with what's pending
4. ‚úÖ Add new verification questions if new concepts introduced
5. ‚úÖ Update "Quick Reference" with new files/commands
6. ‚úÖ Sync architecture-decisions.md, known-issues.md if status changed
7. ‚úÖ Create git commit with session summary

**Example Session Summary Template:**
```markdown
## Last Session Summary (vN‚ÜívN+1)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ [Major accomplishment 1]
- ‚úÖ [Major accomplishment 2]
- ‚úÖ [Files created/modified with line counts]

**Key Learnings:**
- [Important discovery or pattern]
- [Error encountered and how fixed]

**Details:**
- **[Component]:** [Specific changes]
```

**DO NOT PROCEED with new major work if context is at 80%+ without updating handover docs first.**

---

## Last Session Summary (v33‚Üív34)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Result Tracker Schema Bug Fixed:** Fixed outcome_vectors columns (agent_name/operation_type ‚Üí work_order_id/model_used/route_reason)
- ‚úÖ **Schema Validation Protocol (R10):** "Verify before assuming" - regenerate types at session start, curl before testing
- ‚úÖ **Session Start Automation:** Created scripts/session-start.ps1 for type regeneration + TypeScript check
- ‚úÖ **Integration Tests Expanded:** 20/20 passing (added Tests 19-20 for Orchestrator, Tests 21-22 for Sentinel)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3.1 Sentinel Agent Complete:** Full implementation with webhook, decision logic, GitHub Actions integration
- ‚úÖ **Client Manager + Sentinel Specs Created:** Technical specifications documented before implementation

**Key Learnings:**
- **Schema validation critical:** Type mismatches caused by assuming field names without checking supabase.ts
- **Test before writing tests:** curl /api/orchestrator revealed `polling` not `is_running` (prevented Test 20 failure)
- **Outcome vectors scope:** Only writes to outcome_vectors for proposer stage (LLM tracking, not infrastructure)
- **Sentinel architecture:** Localtunnel webhooks for development, 3-retry logic for race conditions, binary pass/fail MVP
- **GitHub Actions integration:** Cross-platform PowerShell tests, ubuntu-latest runners, workflow completion webhooks

**Critical Decisions:**
1. **R10 "Verify before assuming"** added to prevent future schema bugs
2. **Automation first:** scripts/session-start.ps1 ensures types regenerated every session
3. **Sentinel MVP scope:** Binary pass/fail only, no flaky detection, no auto-merge (deferred to Phase 3.2)
4. **Client Manager deferred:** Sentinel can log escalations, full Client Manager implementation pending
5. **Unit tests deferred:** Focused on integration tests + Sentinel implementation instead
