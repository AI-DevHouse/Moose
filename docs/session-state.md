## 🎉 Phase 2 Batched Decomposition - SUCCESS

### The Problem We Solved

**Original Issue:**
- Multi-LLM Discussion App spec failed with JSON truncation
- Assumed Claude had 4000 token output limit
- Implemented complex batching system to work around limit

**Root Cause Discovery:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports **64,000 output tokens** (not 4,000!)
- We had `max_tokens: 4000` hardcoded in all services (self-throttling)
- Reference: `docs/Claude Models Overview.txt` line 142

**Solution:**
- Updated `max_tokens` across all services:
  - Architect: 4000 → 16000
  - Batched Architect: 3800 → 16000
  - Complexity Estimator: 1000 → 2000
- Batching system now works flawlessly with proper token limits

### Test Results - Multi-LLM Discussion App

**Specification:**

🔍 Estimation: 42 work orders estimated, 13 batches proposed
✅ Actual: 53 work orders generated across 13 batches
⏱️  Time: 306 seconds (~5 minutes)

```

### Structured Context Summaries

**Key Innovation:** Batches include summaries of previous work orders to maintain architectural coherence.

**Format:**
```
WO-0: Setup Electron project | File: package.json | Deps: []
WO-1: Configure TypeScript | File: tsconfig.json | Exports: CompilerOptions | Deps: ["0"]
WO-2: Setup IPC layer | File: src/main/ipc/ipc-manager.ts | Exports: IPCManager, sendToRenderer | Deps: ["0", "1"]
```

**Why this works:**
- Preserves architectural information (file paths, exports)
- Compact format (~80 tokens per WO vs 350 for full description)
- Prevents batches from creating duplicate files
- Maintains dependency chain across batches

### Token Budgets (Two Separate Concerns)

**1. Architect OUTPUT tokens (our constraint):**
- What: Tokens used when Architect generates work order JSON
- Limit: 16,000 per batch (Claude supports 64K, we use 16K for safety)
- Controls: Batch size (more batches = more calls, but no truncation)

**2. Proposer CONTEXT tokens (not affected by our changes):**
- What: Tokens Proposer uses to read codebase during execution
- Limit: 200,000 (Claude) or 128,000 (GPT)
- Stored in: `context_budget_estimate` field (800-4000 per WO)
- Used for: Reading files, imports, dependencies, related code

**These are independent!** Making work order descriptions shorter doesn't affect Proposer execution context.

---

## Current System Capabilities

### Architect Can Now Handle:

✅ **Small projects (3-20 WOs):** Single API call, fast path (30-60 seconds)
✅ **Medium projects (21-50 WOs):** Batched decomposition (3-7 batches, 3-5 minutes)
✅ **Large projects (51-100 WOs):** Batched decomposition (8-15 batches, 6-10 minutes)
✅ **Complex architecture:** Multi-process, IPC, encryption, accessibility
✅ **Feature-based batching:** Logical grouping (Infrastructure → Core → UI → Testing)
✅ **Self-healing validation:** Auto-generates missing dependencies
✅ **Contract generation:** API, State, File, Database (IPC needs debugging)

### Known Limitations:

⚠️ **IPC contract parsing fails:** Returns empty array instead of contracts (non-blocking)
⚠️ **Supabase wireframe storage:** Signature verification fails (wireframes generate but don't save)
⚠️ **Estimation variance:** Estimated 42 WOs, actual 53 WOs (26% over, acceptable)
⚠️ **Sequential batching:** Batches run one at a time (could parallelize in future)

## Key Learnings from This Session

### 1. Always Check API Documentation

**Mistake:** Assumed 4000 token limit based on outdated information
**Reality:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports 64,000 output tokens
**Lesson:** Verify limits against official docs before architecting workarounds

### 2. Work Order Design for LLM Agents

**Initial assumption:** Verbose descriptions help Proposers execute work orders
**Reality:** Proposers (Claude/GPT via Aider) work better with:
- Concise descriptions (20-30 words)
- Detailed acceptance criteria (5-7 testable requirements)
- Clear file paths
- Minimal noise

**Reference:** `docs/Analysis_Token_Limit_CORRECTED.md` for full analysis

### 3. Two Token Budgets Are Independent

**Confusion:** Thought reducing work order descriptions would hurt Proposer execution
**Clarification:**
- Architect OUTPUT tokens: For generating work order JSON (4K-16K limit)
- Proposer CONTEXT tokens: For reading codebase during execution (200K limit)
- These are separate! Changes to descriptions don't affect execution context.

### 4. Batching is Still Valuable

Even with 64K token limit, batching provides:
- **Logical organization:** Feature-based grouping aids understanding
- **Parallel execution potential:** Could run batches concurrently (future optimization)
- **Progress reporting:** User sees incremental progress vs single long wait
- **Error isolation:** Batch failure doesn't lose entire decomposition

---

## Rate Limits (Updated Understanding)

### Actual Limits (from API dashboard):

**Claude Sonnet 4.x:**
- Requests per minute: **1,000** (not 4 as previously thought!)
- Input TPM: **450,000**
- Output TPM: **90,000**
- Context window: 200K (1M with beta header)

**What this means:**
- Current rate limiter set to 4 req/min is **250× too conservative**
- We can run batches much faster (no artificial delays needed)
- Could parallelize batch generation in future
- Output TPM (90K) is the real constraint for high-volume use

**Current API endpoint rate limit:** 4 req/min (line 12 in `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts`)
**Recommendation:** Update to 50-100 req/min to enable faster batching

## Next Session Priorities

### Priority 1: Update Rate Limiter (Optional Optimization)

**Current:** 4 requests/minute
**Actual limit:** 1,000 requests/minute
**Recommendation:** Update to 50-100 req/min in `src/app/api/architect/decompose/route.ts:12`

**Impact:**
- Faster batching (no artificial delays)
- Enable concurrent decomposition requests
- Better utilization of API capacity

### Priority 2: Fix IPC Contract Parsing

**Issue:** IPC contract generation fails with parse error
**Location:** Logged during contract generation phase
**Impact:** Non-blocking (returns empty array), but contracts would be useful
**Debug:** Check `src/lib/contract-service.ts` IPC contract generation logic

### Priority 3: Fix Supabase Wireframe Storage (Optional)

**Issue:** "signature verification failed" when saving wireframes
**Location:** `src/lib/wireframe-service.ts:187`
**Impact:** Wireframes generate correctly but don't save to Supabase
**Status:** Low priority (wireframes work, just storage broken)

### Priority 4: Test Proposer Execution with Batched Work Orders

**Goal:** Validate that batched work orders execute correctly via Orchestrator
**Test:** Pick 5-10 work orders from Multi-LLM decomposition and execute via Aider
**Metrics:**
- Success rate
- Code quality
- Test pass rate
- Execution time

**This validates end-to-end workflow:** Batched decomposition → Orchestrator → Proposer → Aider

### Priority 5: Consider Verbose vs Concise Work Orders

**Context:** We explored concise work order format to save tokens
**Discovery:** Token limit was self-imposed, not a real constraint
**Decision needed:** Keep current verbose format or switch to concise?

**Arguments for verbose:**
- Human readability
- Implementation guidance
- Current format works with 16K limit

**Arguments for concise:**
- Better for LLM agents (focused acceptance criteria)
- More efficient token usage
- Could fit more WOs per batch

**Recommendation:** Keep verbose for now, revisit after Proposer execution testing

## Important Context for Next Session

### What Works

✅ **Batched decomposition:** Complex specs (50+ WOs) decompose successfully
✅ **Feature-based batching:** Logical grouping, not arbitrary counts
✅ **Structured context:** File paths + exports preserved across batches
✅ **Self-healing validation:** Detects issues, suggests fixes
✅ **Contract generation:** API, State, File, Database contracts working
✅ **Fast path:** Small projects (<20 WOs) still use single-call optimization

### What's Broken

❌ **IPC contract parsing:** Returns empty array (needs debugging)
⚠️ **Supabase storage:** Wireframes generate but don't save (low priority)

### What's Unknown

❓ **Proposer execution:** Haven't tested batched WOs with actual Aider agents yet
❓ **Cost at scale:** Real-world cost for 100+ WO projects unknown
❓ **Batch parallelization:** Could we run batches concurrently? (Future optimization)

## Technical Debt / Future Improvements

1. **Parallel batch generation:** Run batches concurrently to reduce decomposition time
2. **Cache estimation results:** Don't re-estimate if spec hasn't changed
3. **Smarter batch sizing:** Adjust batch size based on work order complexity (not just count)
4. **IPC contract debugging:** Fix parsing issue
5. **Rate limiter update:** Increase from 4 to 50-100 req/min
6. **Monitoring:** Track decomposition costs, timing, success rates
7. **Work order format:** Consider concise format after Proposer testing

---
