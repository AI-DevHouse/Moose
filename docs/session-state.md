# Session State v34 (2025-10-02)

**Start here each session.** Reference other docs as needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Session Handover Protocol

**üö® ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY - MUST DO BEFORE CONTEXT RUNS OUT üö®**

**When to Update:** At **80-85% of context budget used** (160,000-170,000 tokens of 200,000), pause at the next logical task completion point.

**What Happens if Skipped:** Catastrophic loss of session progress - next session will not know what was accomplished, leading to duplicate work, confusion, and wasted time.

**Update Checklist (REQUIRED):**
1. ‚úÖ Update "Last Session Summary" section with completed work
2. ‚úÖ Update "Current Status" with new completions
3. ‚úÖ Update "Next Immediate Task" with what's pending
4. ‚úÖ Add new verification questions if new concepts introduced
5. ‚úÖ Update "Quick Reference" with new files/commands
6. ‚úÖ Sync architecture-decisions.md, known-issues.md if status changed
7. ‚úÖ Create git commit with session summary

**Example Session Summary Template:**
```markdown
## Last Session Summary (vN‚ÜívN+1)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ [Major accomplishment 1]
- ‚úÖ [Major accomplishment 2]
- ‚úÖ [Files created/modified with line counts]

**Key Learnings:**
- [Important discovery or pattern]
- [Error encountered and how fixed]

**Details:**
- **[Component]:** [Specific changes]
```

**DO NOT PROCEED with new major work if context is at 80%+ without updating handover docs first.**

---

## Last Session Summary (v33‚Üív34)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Result Tracker Schema Bug Fixed:** Fixed outcome_vectors columns (agent_name/operation_type ‚Üí work_order_id/model_used/route_reason)
- ‚úÖ **Schema Validation Protocol (R10):** "Verify before assuming" - regenerate types at session start, curl before testing
- ‚úÖ **Session Start Automation:** Created scripts/session-start.ps1 for type regeneration + TypeScript check
- ‚úÖ **Integration Tests Expanded:** 20/20 passing (added Tests 19-20 for Orchestrator, Tests 21-22 for Sentinel)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3.1 Sentinel Agent Complete:** Full implementation with webhook, decision logic, GitHub Actions integration
- ‚úÖ **Client Manager + Sentinel Specs Created:** Technical specifications documented before implementation

**Key Learnings:**
- **Schema validation critical:** Type mismatches caused by assuming field names without checking supabase.ts
- **Test before writing tests:** curl /api/orchestrator revealed `polling` not `is_running` (prevented Test 20 failure)
- **Outcome vectors scope:** Only writes to outcome_vectors for proposer stage (LLM tracking, not infrastructure)
- **Sentinel architecture:** Localtunnel webhooks for development, 3-retry logic for race conditions, binary pass/fail MVP
- **GitHub Actions integration:** Cross-platform PowerShell tests, ubuntu-latest runners, workflow completion webhooks

**Critical Decisions:**
1. **R10 "Verify before assuming"** added to prevent future schema bugs
2. **Automation first:** scripts/session-start.ps1 ensures types regenerated every session
3. **Sentinel MVP scope:** Binary pass/fail only, no flaky detection, no auto-merge (deferred to Phase 3.2)
4. **Client Manager deferred:** Sentinel can log escalations, full Client Manager implementation pending
5. **Unit tests deferred:** Focused on integration tests + Sentinel implementation instead

2. **Test Sentinel webhook:** Manual POST with valid GitHub signature
3. **Configure GitHub webhook:** Set up repository webhook to trigger on workflow_run completion

## Context Verification (Required Before Work)

Answer these to confirm doc comprehension:

**Q1:** What is the architectural pattern for agent logic organization, and which THREE agents currently follow this pattern?

**Q2:** What are the THREE refinement cycle strategies in Phase 2.2.6, and what triggers the zero-progress abort?

**Q3:** What are the TWO validation thresholds for Phase 2.1 Architect (WO count range and max token budget per WO)?

**Q4:** What is the current cost per decomposition, and what percentage of the monthly LLM budget does this represent at 1-2 decompositions/day?

**Q5:** What are the Director approval thresholds (cost, confidence, risk) for auto-approval, and where are they defined?

**Q6:** What was the refinement success rate in Phase 2.2.6 testing (initial errors ‚Üí final errors ‚Üí improvement %), and how many cycles were used?

**Q7:** What is the dependency validation behavior in v25, why was strict validation relaxed, and what constraint does this temporarily violate?

**Q8:** What is the next phase priority (Phase 2.3 Orchestrator vs Phase 2.5 Client Manager), and what is the key architectural principle about Orchestrator?

**Q9:** What five columns were added to the work_orders table for Architect integration, and were they successfully migrated?

**Q10:** What is the root cause of the Security Hard Stop test failure on cold start, what is the workaround, and what is the planned fix?

**Q11:** What was the root cause of the system_config SQL error during migration, and how was it fixed?

**Q12:** Why did type generation fail using Supabase CLI, and what was the workaround?

**Q13:** What are the 5 stages of the Orchestrator execution pipeline, and what is the concurrency limit?

**Q14:** What are the prerequisites for running Orchestrator E2E tests, and what are the 3 rollback scenarios?

**Q15 (NEW v32):** What metadata fields does the Orchestrator work-order-poller check for Director approval, and why are there two?

**Q16 (NEW v32):** What is the actual API endpoint structure for Orchestrator control (start/stop), and how does it differ from the original spec?

**Q17 (NEW v33):** What was the critical schema bug found in result-tracker.ts, which columns were wrong, and what are the correct column names for outcome_vectors?

**Q18 (NEW v33):** Why was E2E testing deferred in v33, what is the testing sequence (unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí E2E), and how many unit tests are planned?

**Q19 (NEW v33):** What are the Orchestrator prerequisites installed in v33, which Python version is used with Aider, and why?

**Q20 (NEW v33):** What is the purpose of the outcome_vectors table (LLM model tracking vs generic agent activity), and which stages should write to it?
