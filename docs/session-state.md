## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Session Handover Protocol

**🚨 ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY - MUST DO BEFORE CONTEXT RUNS OUT 🚨**

**When to Update:** At **90,000 tokens used** (45% of 200,000 token budget), pause at the next logical task completion point.

**What Happens if Skipped:** Catastrophic loss of session progress - next session will not know what was accomplished, leading to duplicate work, confusion, and wasted time.

**Update Checklist (REQUIRED):**
1. ✅ Update "Last Session Summary" section with completed work
2. ✅ Update "Current Status" with new completions
3. ✅ Update "Next Immediate Task" with what's pending
4. ✅ Add new verification questions if new concepts introduced
5. ✅ Update "Quick Reference" with new files/commands
6. ✅ Sync architecture-decisions.md, known-issues.md if status changed
7. ✅ Create git commit with session summary

**Example Session Summary Template:**
```markdown
## Last Session Summary (vN→vN+1)

**Completed:**
- ✅ [Major accomplishment 1]
- ✅ [Major accomplishment 2]
- ✅ [Files created/modified with line counts]

**Key Learnings:**
- [Important discovery or pattern]
- [Error encountered and how fixed]

**Details:**
- **[Component]:** [Specific changes]
```

**DO NOT PROCEED with new major work if context is at 80%+ without updating handover docs first.**

## Verification Questions (Q1-Q39)

**Context Verification (Answer these to prove understanding)**

### Agent Architecture (Q1-Q8)

**Q1:** What is the architectural pattern for agent logic separation? Name THREE agents that follow this pattern and their file pairs.

**Answer:** Centralized logic in separate rules files. Three agents:
1. Architect: `architect-decomposition-rules.ts` (logic) + `architect-service.ts` (orchestration)
2. Director: `director-risk-assessment.ts` (logic) + `director-service.ts` (orchestration)
3. Manager: `manager-routing-rules.ts` (logic) + `manager-service.ts` (orchestration)

**Q2:** What are the THREE refinement cycle strategies in Phase 2.2.6, and when does each trigger?

**Answer:**
1. Cycle 1-2: Same model with failure context added
2. Cycle 2-3: Switch to higher capability model (gpt-4o-mini → claude-sonnet-4-5)
3. Zero-progress abort: If no improvement between cycles (same error count)

**Q3:** What are the TWO validation thresholds for Phase 2.1 Architect Work Order generation?

**Answer:**
- WO count range: 3-8 Work Orders (too few = not decomposed, too many = overwhelming)
- Max token budget per WO: <4000 tokens

**Q4:** What is the current cost per Architect decomposition call, and what % of monthly LLM budget does this represent at 1-2 calls/day?

**Answer:** $11.30 per call. At 1-2 calls/day = $226-$452/month = 75-150% of £300 LLM budget

**Q5:** What are the Director approval thresholds for auto-approval?

**Answer:** All WOs must be low-risk AND total_cost < $50
(Defined in: director-risk-assessment.ts)

**Q6:** What was the refinement success rate in Phase 2.2.6 testing? (Initial errors → Final errors → Improvement %)

**Answer:** Data not specified in docs (verification needed with test results)

**Q7:** What is the dependency validation behavior in v25, and which constraint does it violate?

**Answer:**
- Relaxed validation: Warns but doesn't block on complex dependency patterns
- Why: Simple cycle detection flagged valid diamond patterns (A,B→C) as circular
- Constraint violated: "Sequential dependencies only" (temporarily violated to allow multi-parent convergence)

**Q8:** What is the next phase priority after Phase 2.2, and what is its key architectural principle?

**Answer:** Phase 2.3 Orchestrator (comes before Phase 2.5 Client Manager)
Key principle: Orchestrator = tooling/infrastructure (Aider CLI), NOT an agent

### Database & Migration (Q9-Q12)

**Q9:** What are the FIVE columns added to work_orders table for Architect integration? Were they successfully migrated?

**Answer:**
1. acceptance_criteria (jsonb)
2. files_in_scope (jsonb)
3. context_budget_estimate (integer)
4. decomposition_doc (text)
5. architect_version (text)
Successfully migrated: ✅ YES (verified in supabase.ts lines 469-479)

**Q10:** What was the root cause of the Security Hard Stop test failure on cold start, and what is the planned fix?

**Answer:**
- Root cause: Config loading race condition - API accepts requests before system_config loaded
- Workaround: Run integration tests twice after server restart
- Planned fix: Add initialization barrier + `/api/health/ready` endpoint + test suite waits for readiness

**Q11:** What caused the system_config SQL error during migration, and how was it fixed?

**Answer:** Not explicitly specified in docs (migration scripts created with safeguards)

**Q12:** Why did type generation fail using Supabase CLI, and what is the workaround?

**Answer:**
- Why failed: Not specified in docs
- Workaround: Manual generation command: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id qclxdnbvoruvqnhsshjr > src/types/supabase.ts`

### Orchestrator (Q13-Q19)

**Q13:** What are the 5 stages of the Orchestrator execution pipeline, and what is the concurrency limit?

**Answer:**
1. Poll (work-order-poller)
2. Route (manager-coordinator - calls Manager API)
3. Generate (proposer-executor - calls Proposer API)
4. Aider (aider-executor - applies code)
5. PR + Track (github-integration + result-tracker)
Concurrency limit: max 3 concurrent

**Q14:** What are the prerequisites for Orchestrator E2E testing, and name 3 rollback scenarios.

**Answer:**
- Prerequisites: Aider CLI installed, GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated
- 3 rollback scenarios: Not explicitly listed in docs (need to check implementation)

**Q15 (v32):** What are the TWO metadata fields used by Orchestrator work-order-poller for Director approval? Why are there two?

**Answer:**
- Two fields: `director_approved` and `approval_status`
- Why two: Belt-and-suspenders approach for approval tracking

**Q16 (v32):** What is the actual API endpoint structure for Orchestrator control? How does it differ from the original spec?

**Answer:**
- Structure: POST `/api/orchestrator` with `{"action":"start"|"stop","interval_ms":10000}`
- Differs from original spec: Single POST endpoint with action parameter vs separate start/stop endpoints

**Q17 (v33):** What was the critical schema bug in result-tracker.ts? What are the correct columns?

**Answer:**
- Wrong columns: `agent_name` and `operation_type`
- Correct columns: `work_order_id`, `model_used`, `route_reason`, `cost`, `execution_time_ms`, `success`, `diff_size_lines`, `test_duration_ms`, `failure_classes`, `metadata`

**Q18 (v33):** Why was E2E testing deferred, and what is the testing sequence? How many unit tests were planned?

**Answer:**
- Why deferred: Attempted 4 times, each revealed new environment issues - focused on Sentinel + Client Manager instead
- Testing sequence: Unit → Integration → E2E
- Unit tests planned: 5 tests (result-tracker, manager-coordinator, proposer-executor, aider-executor, github-integration)

**Q19 (v33):** What Orchestrator prerequisites are installed, and what Python version is required?

**Answer:**
- Prerequisites: Aider CLI, GitHub CLI
- Python version: Python 3.11 with aider-chat 0.86.1
- Why: Specified compatibility/stability version

### Data Flow & Tables (Q20-Q22)

**Q20:** What is the purpose of the outcome_vectors table, and which pipeline stages write to it?

**Answer:**
- Purpose: LLM model performance tracking for Manager's learning system (NOT generic agent activity)
- Which stages write: Proposer stage only (tracks LLM model usage: "gpt-4o-mini generated code for WO-123, cost $0.001, succeeded")

**Q21:** What is Rule R10 "Verify before assuming"? Name 4 verification requirements and the automation script.

**Answer:**
- 4 verification requirements:
  1. Always regenerate types at session start
  2. Curl endpoints before writing tests (verify field names)
  3. Check supabase.ts before DB queries (no field name assumptions)
  4. Read actual metadata structures from DB (don't assume field names)
- Automation script: `scripts/session-start.ps1`

**Q22:** What was the schema bug in result-tracker.ts (v34)? What are the correct columns, and when should you write outcome_vectors?

**Answer:**
- Wrong columns: `agent_name`, `operation_type`
- Correct columns: `work_order_id`, `model_used`, `route_reason`
- When to write outcome_vectors: Proposer stage only (LLM tracking, not infrastructure)

### Sentinel Agent (Q23-Q25)

**Q23:** What are the 3 main components of Sentinel Agent? What is the MVP scope vs Phase 3.2 enhancements?

**Answer:**
- 3 components:
  1. `test-parser.ts` (PowerShell + Jest test output parsing)
  2. `decision-maker.ts` (Pass/fail decision logic)
  3. `sentinel-service.ts` (Main orchestration with retry logic + Client Manager integration)
- MVP scope: Binary pass/fail, 3-retry logic for race conditions, GitHub webhook integration
- Phase 3.2 enhancements: Flaky detection, auto-merge, advanced quality gates (deferred)

**Q24:** How does Sentinel handle the race condition when webhook arrives before github_pr_number is set?

**Answer:** 3-retry logic for when webhook arrives before github_pr_number is set
Alternative solution: Wait for metadata to be populated before processing webhook

**Q25:** What were the integration test results for v34? Why is E2E timeout NOT considered a failure?

**Answer:**
- Results: 21/22 passing (E2E timeout expected)
- E2E timeout NOT a failure: Because it involves actual LLM calls (long-running)
- Tests added: Tests 19-20 (Orchestrator), Tests 21-22 (Sentinel)

### Client Manager (Q26-Q30)

**Q26:** What are the 7 escalation trigger types for Client Manager? What are the 3 conditions for shouldEscalate()?

**Answer:**
- 7 types: retry_exhausted, budget_warning, budget_critical, test_failures, contract_violation, aider_failure, manual_escalation
- 3 conditions for shouldEscalate():
  1. Retry exhausted (attempts ≥ 3)
  2. Budget critical (>$80 spent)
  3. Test failures (repeated >3 cycles)

**Q27:** What are the 5 resolution strategies for Client Manager? What is the cost-efficiency formula?

**Answer:**
- 5 strategies: retry_different_approach, pivot_solution, amend_work_orders, abort_redesign, increase_budget
- Cost-efficiency formula: `score = (success_probability * 100) / (estimated_cost + risk_factor * 10)`

**Q28:** What are the 5 Orchestrator unit tests?

**Answer:**
1. result-tracker.test.ts: Schema validation for outcome_vectors writes
2. manager-coordinator.test.ts: Complexity estimation logic
3. proposer-executor.test.ts: Task description building
4. aider-executor.test.ts: Instruction file formatting
5. github-integration.test.ts: PR body generation

**Q29:** What is the function that integrates Sentinel + Client Manager? What is the API call, and what is the graceful fallback?

**Answer:**
- Function: `escalateToClientManager()` in sentinel-service.ts
- API call: `POST /api/client-manager/escalate`
- Graceful fallback: Manual status update if API call fails

**Q30:** What are the budget threshold levels for Client Manager?

**Answer:**
- $20 (soft cap): Warning status, continue normally
- $50 (hard cap): Force cheapest model (gpt-4o-mini)
- $100 (emergency kill): Stop all operations, escalate to Client Manager

### Manager Integration (Q31-Q33)

**Q31:** What changed in Manager integration (v36)? How many lines of duplicate routing were removed, and how does Proposer call Manager?

**Answer:**
- Change: Proposer service now calls `POST /api/manager` for routing decisions
- Duplicate routing removed: `proposer-registry.ts` lines 110-245 (135 lines removed)
- How Proposer calls Manager: HTTP fetch to `/api/manager` with work_order_id, complexity_score, context

**Q32:** How does Manager handle ad-hoc routing? Why is this necessary?

**Answer:**
- How: Check if work_order exists before DB update (lines 154-164 in manager-service.ts)
- Why necessary: Support ad-hoc routing requests from Proposer service for testing/non-WO scenarios

**Q33:** What were the 3 Manager integration test results in v36?

**Answer:**
1. Low complexity (0.2): Routed to gpt-4o-mini ✅
2. High complexity (0.9) + OAuth keywords: Hard Stop → claude-sonnet-4-5 ✅
3. SQL injection keyword: Hard Stop detected → claude-sonnet-4-5 ✅

### Client Manager v37 (Q34-Q36)

**Q34:** What schema bug was fixed in client-manager-service.ts (v37)?

**Answer:**
- Queried incorrectly: `cost_tracking.work_order_id` (column doesn't exist)
- Should use instead: `outcome_vectors` table with `work_order_id` filter for cost tracking

**Q35:** What are the 5 main sections of the Escalation Details Modal UI?

**Answer:**
1. Work Order context (ID, title, description)
2. Context Summary (cost spent, attempts, failure pattern)
3. AI Recommendation with confidence visualization
4. Resolution Options with pros/cons (green checkmarks/red X)
5. Decision Notes + Execute button
Recommended option highlight: Blue border + star (⭐)

**Q36:** What are the 2 dashboard API methods added for Client Manager in v37?

**Answer:**
1. `getEscalationResolutions(escalationId)`: Fetch resolution options for an escalation
2. `executeEscalationDecision(escalationId, optionId, decidedBy, notes?)`: Execute human's chosen resolution

### v38 Error Handling (Q37-Q39)

**Q37:** What are the 4 phases of v38 Error Handling & Resilience plan? Which are complete?

**Answer:**
1. Phase 1: Error Escalation (error-escalation.ts + audit fixes) - ✅ COMPLETE
2. Phase 2: Budget Race Condition Fix (PostgreSQL locking function) - ✅ COMPLETE
3. Phase 3: Failure Mode Tests (10 tests) - ✅ COMPLETE
4. Phase 4: Monitoring Dashboard - ✅ COMPLETE
All 4 phases: ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE

**Q38:** How does the budget race condition fix work? What PostgreSQL feature prevents the race?

**Answer:**
- Function: `check_and_reserve_budget(p_estimated_cost, p_service_name, p_metadata)`
- PostgreSQL feature: `LOCK TABLE cost_tracking IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE`
- How it works: Atomic check-and-reserve prevents concurrent reads during budget calculation
- Called from: `manager-service.ts` line 194

**Q39:** What are the 10 failure mode tests, and what is the pass rate?

**Answer:**
1. outcome_vectors Write Failure
2. Budget Race Condition
3. Concurrent Work Order Metadata Updates
4. Malformed LLM JSON Response
5. Database Connection Failure
6. GitHub Webhook Race Condition
7. Invalid State Transition
8. Orchestrator Aider Command Failure
9. Sentinel Webhook Invalid Auth Token
10. Work Order Stuck >24h Monitoring
Pass rate: 10/10 passing (100%, 3.6s execution time)
