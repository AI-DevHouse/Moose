    "decomposition_doc": "# Todo App Implementation Plan\n\n## Decomposition Metadata\n- **decomposition_source**: generated\n- **total_work_orders**: 8\n- **estimated_duration**: Sequential completion required\n\n## Overview\nThis implementation plan breaks down the Todo App into 8 sequential work orders, progressing from foundational setup through to polished UI. The approach follows a bottom-up architecture pattern: infrastructure → data layer → components → integration → polish.\n\n## Dependency Chain\n```\nWO-0 (Project Setup)\n  ↓\nWO-1 (localStorage utility)\n  ↓\nWO-2 (State management)\n  ↓\nWO-3 (TodoInput) ──┐\n                    ├→ WO-6 (App integration)\n  ↓                 │      ↓\nWO-4 (TodoItem)     │   WO-7 (Styling & polish)\n  ↓                 │\nWO-5 (TodoList) ────┘\n```\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Work Order Chunking Strategy\n1. **WO-0: Foundation First** - Establishes TypeScript configuration and project structure to enable type-safe development from the start\n2. **WO-1: Data Persistence Layer** - Isolates localStorage logic into reusable utility before state management needs it\n3. **WO-2: State Management Core** - Creates the central data management layer that all components will consume\n4. **WO-3-5: Component Isolation** - Each UI component built independently with clear contracts, enabling parallel development in future iterations\n5. **WO-6: Integration** - Brings all pieces together in main App component\n6. **WO-7: Polish** - Final UX refinements and responsive design completion\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Low Risk (6 WOs)**: Standard React patterns, well-documented APIs\n- **Medium Risk (2 WOs)**: State management integration and App-level coordination\n- **No High Risk**: Project scope is well-defined with proven technologies\n\n### Token Budget Analysis\n- All work orders within safe limits (<2000 tokens each)\n- Total estimated context budget: 9,000 tokens\n- No work orders require splitting\n\n### Mobile-Responsive Strategy\n- Mobile-first CSS approach throughout component development\n- Dedicated polish phase (WO-7) for cross-device testing\n- Touch target sizing enforced in TodoItem component\n\n## Testing Strategy\nEach work order includes implicit testing requirements:\n- WO-1: localStorage utility testing\n- WO-2-6: Component functionality verification\n- WO-7: Cross-device responsive testing\n\n## Acceptance Criteria Mapping\n| Specification Requirement | Work Order | Validation Point |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------------|\n| Create todos | WO-3, WO-6 | TodoInput integration |\n| Mark complete | WO-4, WO-6 | TodoItem toggle functionality |\n| Delete todos | WO-4, WO-6 | TodoItem delete button |\n| localStorage persistence | WO-1, WO-2 | Page refresh test |\n| Mobile-responsive | WO-3-7 | Multi-device testing |\n\n## Notes\n- TypeScript strict mode recommended for type safety\n- Consider adding todo ID generation strategy in WO-2\n- localStorage quota limits should be documented in WO-1\n- Accessibility testing should be included in WO-7 validation",
