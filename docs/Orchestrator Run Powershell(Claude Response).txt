## Recurring Problems Analysis

### Critical Issues

**Git Branch Conflicts (3 failures)**
- Work orders failing because feature branches already exist in the repository
- Error: `fatal: a branch named 'feature/wo-{id}-...' already exists`
- Root cause: Orchestrator attempting to re-create branches from previous runs
- **Fix needed**: Check if branch exists before creation, or delete/reuse existing branches

**GitHub PR Number Extraction (Every successful WO)**
- JQ expression syntax error when retrieving PR numbers
- Error: `failed to parse jq expression... unexpected token "'"`
- Likely: Windows/PowerShell quote escaping issue with the gh CLI command
- **Fix needed**: Adjust quote handling in GitHubIntegration for Windows

**Database Schema Mismatch**
- ResultTracker trying to write to non-existent `action` column in `github_events` table
- Error occurs after every work order completion
- Database schema out of sync with code expectations
- **Fix needed**: Run migration to add missing column or update code to match schema

### Performance Issues

**Aider Asking Questions vs. Executing**
- Some work orders show Aider requesting clarification instead of implementing
- Examples: WO 666660fb asked about IPC architecture, WO a97e01e0 asked about authentication
- Creates delays and prevents autonomous execution
- **Fix needed**: Provide more complete context in work order instructions or improve prompt specificity

**Capacity Bottleneck**
- Frequent "[CapacityManager] Waiting for claude-sonnet-4-5 capacity (2/2 active)" messages
- Max concurrent limit of 3 WOs, but only 2 Claude slots available
- Creates cascading delays when multiple WOs need the same model
- **Fix needed**: Consider increasing Claude capacity limit or adding GPT-4o-mini for simpler tasks

**Long Execution Times**
- Individual work orders taking 2-4 minutes to complete
- WO 666660fb: ~3.8 minutes, WO a97e01e0: ~2.2 minutes
- Mostly waiting for Claude API responses
- **Fix needed**: May be unavoidable, but consider parallel execution optimization

### Minor Issues

**Aider Terminal Warnings**
- Repeated warnings about xterm-256color terminal type in Windows
- Doesn't prevent execution but clutters logs
- **Fix needed**: Set appropriate terminal environment variable or suppress warnings

**EventEmitter Listeners Missing**
- Multiple `[EventEmitter] No listeners for {wo-id}, event: started/progress/completed`
- Suggests UI/monitoring not connected to these events
- **Fix needed**: Add listeners if real-time monitoring is needed, or remove logs if intentional

## Recommended Priority

1. **Immediate**: Fix branch conflict issue (blocking 3 WOs)
2. **High**: Fix database schema for github_events
3. **High**: Fix GitHub PR number extraction  
4. **Medium**: Improve work order context to reduce Aider questions
5. **Medium**: Review capacity management strategy
6. **Low**: Clean up terminal warnings
