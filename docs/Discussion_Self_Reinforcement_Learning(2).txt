The purpose of this discussion is to work out how to reduce cost in development.
Currently our thinking is to train 4o-mini so it is capable of handling all or most of the WOs.
Claude 4.5 will be the reviewer and trainer and manage updates to the governing principles prompt.

Specific WO advice will only be applied to the governing principles if it is successful and identified as a recurring need.

I would like you to:

1) Review the below and compare it to the current reality of the system, highlighting what changes would need to be made.
2) Compare it to the current prompt-enhancement plan.
3) Provide recommendations as to the best way to achieve the above goals.


Workflow: WO Lifecycle from Tech Spec to Performance Benchmarks

Column 1 – Main Linear Flow

Tech Spec

Decompose WOs

WO Contract Check

Complexity Assigned

Governing Principles Prompt

WOs go to Base Proposer

Performance Benchmarks

Column 2 – Trainer Feedback Loop (Left Side)

From Logs → Logs Reviewed by Advanced AI “Trainer” → WO Specific Advice → Proposer Coding

Purpose:
The trainer AI reviews logs, identifies weaknesses or improvements, generates targeted WO-specific advice, and routes it back into the coding step.

Column 3 – Principles Feedback Loop (Right Side)

From Performance Benchmarks → Successful Advice Added to Principles → Governing Principles Prompt

Purpose:
When successful approaches are detected (validated by performance metrics), they are generalized and added to the governing principles used in future proposals.

System Characteristics

Bidirectional learning: both feedback loops (Trainer and Principles) refine future performance.

Autonomy layers:

Base Proposer handles generation.

Trainer AI handles pattern learning from logs.

Governing Principles layer acts as shared intelligence.

Review & reinforcement: all changes are validated through implementation testing and benchmark logging.
