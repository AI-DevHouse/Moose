## Summary of Minor Errors

### Aider Process Failures (3 WOs)

**1. Git Branch Creation Failure**
- **WO ID:** `178325e4`
- **Title:** Implement localStorage utility layer
- **Error:** `Failed to create feature branch: Command failed: git checkout -b feature/wo-...`
- **Classification:** unclassified
- **Analysis:** Branch may already exist from previous run, or git working directory issue
- **Recommendation:** Will likely resolve on retry. If persists, add branch cleanup logic.

**2-3. Aider Null Exit Code (2 occurrences)**
- **WO IDs:** `826a8b13`, `ca68150a`
- **Titles:**
  - Integration and E2E Test Suites
  - Documentation, Build Configuration, and Production Packaging
- **Error:** `Aider exited with code null`
- **Classification:** orchestration_error
- **Analysis:** Process terminated without proper exit code (killed/timeout/signal)
- **Recommendation:** Will likely resolve on retry. If persists, need timeout handling improvements.

### GitHub PR Failure (1 WO)

**1. gh CLI Command Failed**
- **WO ID:** `d8d41cd4`
- **Title:** Implement Performance Optimization and Resource Management System
- **Error:** `Failed to create PR: Command failed: "C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" pr create --title...`
- **Classification:** orchestration_error
- **Analysis:** gh CLI command failed - could be auth, network, or rate limit
- **Recommendation:** Will likely resolve on retry. If persists, check gh auth status.

## Resolution Strategy

All 4 errors are likely **transient** and should resolve on retry:

1. **Git branch failure:** Branch cleanup or retry will fix
2. **Aider null exit:** Process management issue, should work on second attempt
3. **GitHub PR failure:** Likely network/auth issue, should work on retry

**Action:** Reset all 32 failed WOs to `pending` status and retry with fixes applied.

## Expected Outcomes After Retry

### With Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Capacity timeout bug fixed (15 WOs)
- ✅ Budget limit removed (13 WOs)
- ✅ Aider model bug fixed (all future WOs)
- ⚠️ Minor errors (4 WOs) - likely resolve on retry

### Success Projection:
- **Best case:** 32/32 failures resolved (100%)
- **Conservative:** 28/32 failures resolved (87.5%)
- **Worst case:** 26/32 failures resolved (81%)

## No Code Changes Required

All identified errors appear to be transient or already fixed:
- Timeout bug: ✅ Fixed in code
- Budget limit: ✅ Disabled in code
- Model bug: ✅ Fixed in code
- Minor errors: Will retry

**Ready to proceed with rebuild and restart.**
