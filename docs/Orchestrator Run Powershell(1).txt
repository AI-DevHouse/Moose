src\
[Aider]  have a few questions:

1. **IPC
[Aider] main\services\providers\adapters
[Aider] \GeminiSelectors.ts
```
[Aider]  Channel Naming Convention**: The generated code uses ca
[Aider] melCase for the enum
[Aider]  values (e.g., `Window
[Aider]
export const GeminiSelectors = {
[Aider]
  INPUT: 'textarea[
[Aider] Management`), but looking at the existing
[Aider] aria-label="Chat input"]',
[Aider]
  RESPONSE_CONTAINER:
[Aider]  codebase (e.g., `window
[Aider]  '.response-container',
  CODE_BLOCK: 'code.
[Aider] :minimize`,
[Aider] code-block',
  STREAMING
[Aider] _INDICATOR: '.streaming-cursor',
[Aider]
  RESPONSE_CARD: '.model-response-text
[Aider]  `window:maximize`
[Aider] ',
  MULTI_MODAL_CONTENT: '.multi-modal-container
[Aider]  in Header.tsx), it
[Aider] '
} as const;
```

src\main\services\providers\
[Aider]  appears the actual IPC channels use co
[Aider] adapters\GrokSelectors.ts
```
export const Grok
[Aider] Selectors = {
  INPUT: '.grok-input-field',
[Aider] lon-separated naming (e.g., `window
[Aider]
  RESPONSE_CONTAINER: '.grok-response',

[Aider] TWITTER_INTEGRATION: '.twitter-content',
  STREAMING_
[Aider] :minimize`). Should I follow the existing
[Aider] INDICATOR: '.grok-typing',

[Aider]  these sites have security measures (cookie requirements,
[Aider]  Cloudflare protection, sign-in requirements) that will
[Aider]  prevent them from loading properly in webviews.

**
[Aider] Questions:**

1. **Authentication**:
[Aider]  How should the webviews handle authentication? The sites require users
[Aider]  to be signed in. Should we:
   - Use
[Aider]  a persistent session with `partition` attribute?
   - Implement OAuth

[Aider]  flows?
   - Expect users to manually
[Aider]  sign in within each webview?

2. **Provider
[Aider]  State Integration**: The generated code references `state.providers[providerId]` with
[Aider]  properties like `connected`, `responding`, `
[Aider] lastResponse`, and `error`. However, I
[Aider]  don't see a `providersSlice` in the rea
[Aider] d-only files. Should I:
   - Create type
[Aider]  definitions that match an existing Redux slice structure
[Aider] ?
   - Assume a specific shape
[Aider]  for the provider state?

3. **Web
[Aider] View Security**: The generated code uses `

[Aider]  the security requirements mentioned, should we:
   - Ad
[Aider] d additional security policies?
   - Implement CS
[Aider] P headers?
   - Add preload scripts
[Aider]  for monitoring?

4. **Response Detection
[Aider] **: The acceptance criteria mention "real-time response detection status
[Aider] ". How should we detect when a provider is responding? Should we:

[Aider] - Monitor DOM changes in the webview?
   - Use
[Aider]  IPC communication with preload scripts?
   - Poll
[Aider]  for specific elements?

5. **Provider
[Aider]  Type System**: The code references types
[Orchestrator] At max concurrent executions (3), waiting...
[Orchestrator] At max concurrent executions (3), waiting...
[Orchestrator] At max concurrent executions (3), waiting...
[Orchestrator] At max concurrent executions (3), waiting...
[Aider]  from `../../types/provider.ts` which
[Aider]  doesn't exist yet. Should I create
[Aider]  this file, or does it already exist elsewhere in
[Aider]  your codebase?

Could you clarify these points so I can
[Aider]  implement the components correctly?

These files
[Aider]  now provide:

1. **
[Aider] Comprehensive error classification** - Categorises failures into recov
[Aider] erable, transient, and fatal with specific
[Aider]  error categories
2. **Multiple recovery strategies** - Retry
[Aider] , skip provider, pause discussion, abort, rollback state,
[Aider]  and partial recovery
3. **Circuit breaker pattern
[Aider] ** - Prevents repeated calls to failing providers with open
[Aider] /closed/half-open states
4. **
[Aider] Partial recovery support** - Allows discussions to continue with
[Aider]  a subset of providers
5. **Rich error
[Aider]  context** - Includes stack traces, provider
[Aider]  states, and turn metadata with PII sanit
[Aider] isation
6. **User notifications** - Provides actionable error messages
[Aider]  and recovery options
7. **Persistent
[Aider]  error logs** - Logs errors with sanitised data
[Aider]  for debugging
8. **State management integration
[Aider] ** - Supports rollback and checkpoint operations
