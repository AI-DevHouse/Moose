Claude Code’s recommended plan is strategically excellent — it unifies your short-cycle WO improvement and long-cycle Moose evolution into a self-reinforcing architecture that’s both measurable and extensible.
Here’s a breakdown of how strong it is, where I’d refine it slightly, and how it dovetails with your existing 3-column workflow.

✅ What’s Strong

1. Two-Loop Architecture (Micro + Macro)

The Proposer Learning loop handles syntax-level and prompt optimization per WO.

The Iterative Improvement loop handles system-level quality using your 1-10 scoring rubrics.
→ This aligns perfectly with your left/right “Trainer” and “Principles” feedback loops.

2. Objective Acceptance Layer

The proposed validateWorkOrderAcceptance() function bridges compile-success to real functionality.

Automatically runs build, test, lint, and TODO counting — exactly the missing link between WO completion and benchmark evaluation.

Storing results in work_orders.acceptance_result (JSONB) is ideal for your Trainer’s scoring feed.

3. Tight Database Integration

The three tables (test_iterations, iteration_work_order_logs, moose_improvements) map directly onto your macro-loop data flow.

This enables real performance benchmarking without manual scoring overhead.

4. Implementation Phasing

Phases 3–5 sequence the dependencies correctly:

Finish Proposer Learning → Add Acceptance Checks → Layer Iterative Improvement.

Each phase adds instrumentation but reuses existing data models.

5. Prompts + Principles Merge

Injecting Iterative Improvement findings into buildClaudePrompt() unifies the Trainer (left column) with the Principles loop (right column).

That ensures real behavioral inheritance across iterations.

⚙️ My Recommended Refinements
Area	Suggestion	Rationale
Acceptance Scoring Function	Expand calculateAcceptanceScore() to output per-dimension sub-scores (architecture, completeness, etc.) rather than one aggregate.	Enables immediate rubric-based Trainer feedback without waiting for macro-iteration.
WO Lifecycle Hooks	Trigger the acceptance validator before final WO completion status is set, and mark failures as "needs_review" not "needs_rework".	Keeps semantic clarity: “review” = awaiting Trainer evaluation.
Trainer Feedback Granularity	Feed only the delta (improvement or regression) from last iteration into prompt_enhancements.	Prevents redundant or conflicting prompt inflation.
Benchmark Trigger	When three consecutive iterations ≥ 8/10, automatically queue a “Principle Proposal” entry for manual review before it becomes canonical.	Keeps human-in-the-loop governance consistent with your supervised-mode philosophy.
Visualization Alignment	In your 3-column diagram, label left loop “Proposer/Trainer (Micro)” and right loop “Iterative Improvement (Macro)” to reflect this duality explicitly.	Makes the architecture self-documenting when you share with others or future agents.

🧩 Verdict

Claude’s plan is:

Technically sound (clear interfaces, safe phasing)

Data-driven (quantitative metrics integrated)

Aligned with your governance model (supervised → autonomous transition)

I’d adopt it almost verbatim, with the minor refinements above to tighten the scoring granularity and governance checkpoints.
