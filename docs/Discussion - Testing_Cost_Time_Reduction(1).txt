# Strategies to Reduce Iteration Time & Cost

You're right - **12-15 hours √ó 10 iterations = 120-150 hours is completely impractical**. Here's how to get meaningful improvement data while cutting time by 80-95% and cost by 50-90%.

---

## Strategy 1: **Progressive Spec Sizing** üéØ RECOMMENDED

**Problem:** Testing on a 77K production app is overkill for early iterations.

**Solution:** Build a test suite of progressively larger applications.

### Test Application Ladder:

| App | Spec Size | WOs | Time | Cost | Use Case |
|-----|-----------|-----|------|------|----------|
| **Nano** | 3-5K | 15-25 | 10-15 min | $1-2 | Smoke test, basic validation |
| **Tiny** | 8-12K | 40-60 | 30-45 min | $3-5 | Dependency logic, risk assessment |
| **Small** | 15-25K | 80-120 | 60-90 min | $6-10 | Multi-component apps, complexity |
| **Medium** | 30-40K | 150-250 | 2-3 hrs | $12-18 | Real architecture, state management |
| **Large** | 77K | 550-650 | 12-15 hrs | $35-45 | Final validation only |

### Iteration Strategy:

```
Iterations 1-3: Nano app (validate basic improvements)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test: Dependency graph accuracy
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test: Risk assessment
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time: 30-45 min total
  
Iterations 4-6: Small app (validate scaling)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test: Multi-component dependencies
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test: Cross-cutting concerns
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time: 3-4 hours total
  
Iterations 7-8: Medium app (validate complexity)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test: State management decomposition
  ‚îú‚îÄ Test: Architecture boundaries
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time: 4-6 hours total
  
Iteration 9-10: Large app (final validation)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Full production test
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time: 24-30 hours total

Total time: 35-45 hours (vs 120-150 hours)
Total cost: $80-120 (vs $350-450)
```

### Example Test Specs to Create:

**Nano: Todo MVC App**
```
- Express REST API
- React frontend
- SQLite database
- JWT auth
- CRUD operations
```
**Expected:** 20-30 WOs, 15 min, validates basic decomposition

**Small: Blog Platform**
```
- Next.js with API routes
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- User auth + roles
- Post CRUD + comments
- Image uploads
- RSS feed
```
**Expected:** 60-100 WOs, 45-60 min, validates multi-tier dependencies

**Medium: Analytics Dashboard**
```
- React + Redux
- Multiple chart types
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- User management
- Report generation
- Export to CSV/PDF
```
**Expected:** 150-200 WOs, 2-3 hrs, validates complex state management

---

## Strategy 2: **Partial Spec Testing** ‚ö° FAST

**Problem:** Full spec takes 12 hours, but most issues appear in first few sections.

**Solution:** Test only first 40% of spec (Sections 1-6).

### Truncated Testing:

```typescript
// Create abbreviated version of large spec
function createPartialSpec(fullSpec: string, sections: number[]): string {
  // Extract only specified sections
  return extractSections(fullSpec, sections);
}

// Test spec = Sections 1-6 (skip 7-15)
const testSpec = createPartialSpec(multiLLMSpec, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
```

**Sections 1-6 include:**
- Executive Summary ‚úÖ
- Architecture ‚úÖ
- Tech Stack ‚úÖ
- **Component Specs (the big one)** ‚úÖ
- UI Components ‚úÖ
- Error Handling ‚úÖ

**Skipped (less critical for validation):**
- Testing (can infer from component quality)
- Performance, Security (smaller sections)
- Build/Deploy (low WO count)
- Documentation sections

### Results:

| Metric | Full Spec | Sections 1-6 | Savings |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Work Orders | 600 | ~350 | 42% |
| Time | 12 hrs | 6-7 hrs | 45% |
| Cost | $40 | $22-25 | 40% |
| Coverage | 100% | 85% | Acceptable |

**When to use:** Iterations 4-8 (after basic validation, before final test)

---

## Strategy 3: **Switch to GPT-4o-mini for Iterations** üí∞ CHEAP

**Problem:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 costs $40 per run.

**Solution:** Use 4o-mini for improvement iterations, Claude for baseline/final.

### Hybrid Approach:

```
Iteration 1: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (BASELINE)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Purpose: Establish quality benchmark
  ‚îú‚îÄ Cost: $40
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time: 12 hours
  
Iterations 2-9: GPT-4o-mini (IMPROVEMENTS)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Purpose: Test improvements rapidly
  ‚îú‚îÄ Cost per run: $2
  ‚îú‚îÄ Total cost: $16 (8 iterations)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time per run: 10-12 hours (similar)
  
Iteration 10: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (VALIDATION)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Purpose: Confirm improvements work with best model
  ‚îú‚îÄ Cost: $40
  ‚îî‚îÄ Time: 12 hours

Total: $96 (vs $400)
```

**Trade-off:** Accept lower quality from 4o-mini during iteration phase. You're testing *improvements to the system*, not final output quality.

**Key insight:** If your improvements work with 4o-mini, they'll work even better with Claude.

---

## Strategy 4: **Validation-Only Testing** üîç NO EXECUTION

**Problem:** Full test = decomposition ($40) + execution ($200-400) + review time.

**Solution:** For iterations, skip execution entirely. Only validate decomposition quality.

### Process:

```
1. Decompose spec ‚Üí Generate work orders [$40, 12 hrs]
2. Run validation suite ‚Üí Catch errors [free, 5 min]
3. Analyze metrics ‚Üí Score quality [free, 30 min]
4. Make improvements ‚Üí Update Moose code
5. SKIP execution ‚Üí No Orchestrator run [save $200-400, save 3-6 hrs]
6. Repeat
```

### Quality Metrics (No Execution Needed):

**Decomposition Quality:**
- ‚úÖ Dependency graph validity (circular, missing, orphaned)
- ‚úÖ File path accuracy
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment consistency
- ‚úÖ Scope granularity (not too large/small)
- ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria specificity
- ‚úÖ Coverage completeness

**You can measure all of these without executing a single work order.**

### Sampling for Execution:

When you DO need execution validation:

```typescript
// Select representative sample: 20-30 WOs out of 600
const sample = selectRepresentativeSample(allWorkOrders, {
  byRisk: { high: 5, medium: 10, low: 5 },
  byType: { foundation: 5, feature: 10, ui: 5 },
  byComplexity: { high: 8, medium: 10, low: 2 }
});

// Execute only these 20-30 WOs
// Cost: $20-60 (vs $200-400)
// Time: 30-60 min (vs 3-6 hours)
```

**When to use:** Every 3rd iteration (1, 4, 7, 10) to validate execution quality.

---

## Strategy 5: **Section-Specific Testing** üéØ TARGETED

**Problem:** Testing all 15 sections when only fixing dependency logic.

**Solution:** Test only the sections that exercise the improvement.

### Example: Improving Dependency Detection

```typescript
// Only decompose Section 4 (Component Specifications)
// This section has the most complex dependencies

const section4 = extractSection(fullSpec, 4);
const workOrders = await architect.decompose(section4);

// Validate dependency graph
const validation = validateDependencyGraph(workOrders);

// Time: 2-3 hours (vs 12 hours)
// Cost: $8-12 (vs $40)
// Focus: 100% relevant to improvement
```

### Section-to-Improvement Mapping:

| Improvement Area | Test Section(s) | Time | Cost |
|------------------|-----------------|------|------|
| Dependency logic | Section 4 (Components) | 2-3 hrs | $8-12 |
| Risk assessment | Sections 6, 9 (Error, Security) | 1-2 hrs | $4-8 |
| Scope granularity | Section 5 (UI Components) | 1-2 hrs | $4-8 |
| File path accuracy | Section 11 (Project Structure) | 15 min | $1-2 |
| IPC pairing | Section 4.6 (IPC Communication) | 30 min | $2-3 |

**When to use:** When making targeted improvements to specific validation rules.

---

## Strategy 6: **Synthetic Specs** üß™ CONTROLLED

**Problem:** Real specs have unknown complexity. Hard to isolate specific issues.

**Solution:** Generate synthetic specs with known properties.

### Example: Dependency Test Spec

```typescript
// Generate spec with known dependency graph
const syntheticSpec = generateSpec({
  components: 20,
  dependencyDepth: 5,
  circularDependencies: 2,  // Intentional - should be caught
  missingDependencies: 3,   // Intentional - should be caught
  orphanedComponents: 2     // Intentional - should be caught
});

// Decompose
const workOrders = await architect.decompose(syntheticSpec);

// Validate - know ground truth
const validation = validateAgainstGroundTruth(workOrders, syntheticSpec.groundTruth);

// Time: 5-10 min
// Cost: $0.50-1
// Precision: 100% - you know exactly what should happen
```

### Synthetic Spec Templates:

**Template 1: Dependency Hell**
- 30 components with complex dependencies
- Tests dependency graph logic
- 5 min, $0.50

**Template 2: Risk Assessment**
- Mix of high/medium/low risk tasks
- Known risk keywords
- Tests risk classification
- 3 min, $0.30

**Template 3: File Path Maze**
- Similar file names (typo detection)
- Deep directory structures
- Tests path validation
- 2 min, $0.20

**When to use:** Unit testing specific validation rules. Not for end-to-end validation.

---

## Strategy 7: **Parallel Testing** ‚ö° SAME TIME

**Problem:** Testing variations sequentially takes 3√ó longer.

**Solution:** Run multiple decompositions in parallel.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Baseline
npm run decompose -- --spec multi-llm.txt --model claude-4.5 --label baseline

# Terminal 2: Improvement A (new dependency rules)
npm run decompose -- --spec multi-llm.txt --model claude-4.5 --label improved-deps

# Terminal 3: Improvement B (GPT-4o-mini)
npm run decompose -- --spec multi-llm.txt --model gpt-4o-mini --label mini-test

# All finish in ~12 hours (same as sequential)
# Cost: 3√ó but results come 3√ó faster
```

**Trade-off:** Higher cost for faster iteration cycles.

**When to use:** When you have multiple hypotheses to test and time is more valuable than money.

---

## Strategy 8: **Checkpoint-Based Testing** üíæ RESUMABLE

**Problem:** 12-hour runs can't be interrupted for improvements.

**Solution:** Save state after each section, allow resuming.

```typescript
// After each section completes
await saveCheckpoint({
  sessionId,
  completedSections: [1, 2, 3],
  workOrders: allWorkOrdersSoFar,
  metrics: validationMetrics
});

// If issues found after Section 3, stop and improve
if (validationMetrics.criticalErrors > 10) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  High error rate detected. Fix and resume.');
  process.exit(0);
}

// Later: Resume from checkpoint
await resumeDecomposition({
  sessionId,
  startFromSection: 4
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Don't waste 6 hours if Section 4 will fail
- Can improve and resume
- Iterates on remaining sections only

3. üíæ **Save all work orders** - This is your ground truth

### For Next Iterations:

**Week 1: Build Test Suite**
```bash
# Create synthetic specs
npm run create-test-specs

# Creates:
# - specs/test-nano-todo.txt (3K)
# - specs/test-small-blog.txt (12K)
# - specs/test-medium-dashboard.txt (30K)
```

**Week 2: Rapid Iteration**
```bash
# Test improvements on nano spec
for i in {1..5}; do
  npm run test-decomposition -- \
    --spec specs/test-nano-todo.txt \
    --model gpt-4o-mini \
    --iteration $i
done

# Analyze results
npm run analyze-iterations
```

**Week 3: Scale Testing**
```bash
# Test on progressively larger specs
npm run test-decomposition --spec test-small --model claude-4.5
npm run test-decomposition --spec partial-large --model claude-4.5
npm run test-decomposition --spec full-large --model claude-4.5
```
